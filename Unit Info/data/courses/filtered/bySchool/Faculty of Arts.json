Typical assessments in the majors and minors will include essays, oral presentations, active participation in lectures and/or tutorial and seminars, online and in-class quizzes, individual and group projects and multi-media presentations e.g. posters, videos, blogs. Formal examinations are going to be part of the assessment in some units. Course-based assessment will be introduced in the foundation units using a set of capability statements and an e-portfolio. This will include reflective essays, learning logs, memos. Throughout the course you will be provided with milestones/opportunities to receive formative feedback on the development of your e-portfolio. For example, you will be asked to submit mini reflections on the performance in particular assessments in your majors or write some action plans about how to improve your performance in some of the capabilities. Your final e-portfolio will be summatively assessed by a panel of academics and industry partners in the third year as the largest piece of assessment in your Capstone Unit. This will include the submission of a complete portfolio and a presentation.</p>",

      "assessment": "<p>You will be exposed to a wide range of assessment tasks through this course. The majority of these are individual pieces of work oriented at developing the critical thinking, practical and communication skills required for a career in planning. The most common assessments involve writing essays and reports on contemporary planning and land-management topics; writing reviews and evaluations of current policies and approaches; and making presentations and participating in discussions with your peers. Other individual assessment tasks may include quizzes, exams, proposals, research projects, essays and critical reflections. You will also be required to work in groups on group assessment tasks that will reflect your knowledge, as well as teamwork and communication skills.</p>\n<p>Clear standards and criteria for coursework are included in the relevant unit guides. Marking rubrics provided for specific assessment tasks to help tailor your work to what is expected. Feedback on submitted assignments takes a range of forms but will generally involve written notes regarding the strengths and weaknesses of your work as well as either quantitative or qualitative assessment in accordance to the assessment marking rubric. Teaching staff can also provide feedback in-class or through personal appointments for further feedback and guidance. Constructive peer feedback may be sought for some assessment tasks, particularly those that require presentations. When conducting research for a public, private or community sector organisation as part of your training, feedback will also be sought from these entities.</p>\n<p>One of the major assessment tasks of the course is based on work undertaken in the fourth-year Planning and Design capstone unit, where you will undertake a planning design project based in Sydney to showcase your skills in project planning. The Planning and Design unit will provide you with an opportunity to consolidate, integrate and synthesise prior learning and knowledge across multiple subjects of the program and provide opportunities to present this work to peers, academic staff and industry professionals.</p>",

This specialist degree aims to provide you with comprehensive and thorough perspectives on the human past through interdisciplinary study of the material remains of ancient societies. The course aims to provide you with comprehensive and thorough perspectives on human past through the study of the material remains pertaining to ancient societies. It can be completed in three years, either in a full-time study mode or part-time equivalent. The degree involves mandatory participation in domestic and international archaeological excavations and surveys under the direction of Macquarie scholars or those sponsored by other institutions. This multidisciplinary course crosses the traditional arts/science divide by integrating core Archaeology and Ancient History subjects alongside a broad selection of science subjects, offered through a number of Specialisations. This structure, which is flexible enough to accommodate backgrounds in the arts, sciences, or a blend of both, assists you in shaping a degree tailored to your personal interests. You are encouraged to explore and undertake research across disciplinary boundaries, and consider the ways in which archaeological practices can influence other disciplines or draw on them, thus affording them the necessary knowledge and skills required for subsequent learning and research at postgraduate level.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The Bachelor of Media and Communications uses a range of learning and teaching methods to enable students to achieve the course level outcomes. Unit learning outcomes are constructively aligned with the course level outcomes and graduate capabilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures: While some lectures are delivered in traditional face-to-face format, the Bachelor of Media and Communications also utilises lecture recordings and pre-recorded video lectures. The array of formats in which lectures are available ensures that students have access to the lecture materials at any point during the semester.</li>\n<li>Tutorials: Tutorials provide an opportunity for students to critically engage with the selected topic(s). Tutorials provide three key markers: First, they provide forums for resolving uncertainties within and questions about the set materials and topics. Second, tutorial participation generates knowledge. Through tutor-led and peer-assisted direction, students generate knowledge of the subject. Third, tutorials enable students to put generated knowledge into practice through activities such as discussion, debate, group tasks and presentations. Additionally, the knowledge generated in tutorials underpins assessment structures and tasks.</li>\n<li>Workshops: Production units within the course utilise workshops in which students develop production skills such as genre writing, video editing or coding with a JavaScript framework. Guided workshops enable students to generate knowledge and apply it to an individual or group production such as a piece of music journalism or trans-media project spanning radio, screen production and web design offerings. Student learning is supported by teaching and technical staff with industry-grade knowledge and skills.</li>\n<li>Teaching materials: The Bachelor of Media and Communications uses a range of teaching materials to support and direct student learning:<br />a. lectures (face-to-face and recorded)<br />b. traditional paper-based and electronic readings<br />c. text books<br />d. audiovisual material<br />e. group task handouts/worksheets<br />f. online workshop manuals<br />g. industry speakers<br />h. student conference</li>\n<li>Course structure: The course (with a qualifying major in an area of media) is weaved through 1000, 2000 and 3000 level offerings. 1000 level units facilitate comprehension, understanding and application. At 2000 level students develop critical and sophisticated analytical and production skills in addition to acquiring further knowledge. The 3000 level units build on students' development through previous level and encourages evaluation: students graduate with an impressive skill set and knowledge that embeds critical reflection. The media ecology is ever changing and to work within it mandates a commitment to life-long learning. At 3000 level, students become reflective practitioners poised to critically evaluate their own practices and experiences. This is especially pronounced in the capstone unit which prepares students for employment Students are encouraged to experience other disciplines to benefit from a broader knowledge. The PACE unit enhances the student experience through community engagement. The course requires students to select a major in an area of media practice. Students are left with a generous number of flexible credit points that can be used to incorporate a second major in another area of media practice or for elective study. The Bachelor of Media and Communication provides students with the opportunity to develop core academic and media specific skills but offers flexibility with a generous number of electives that can be used to pursue wider learning activities.</li>\n</ul>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "The Bachelor of Media and Communications is an undergraduate degree focused on the analysis, critique and production of media. This degree is can be completed in three years in a full-time study mode. The extent to which media permeates aspects of everyday life is almost overwhelming. The internet has released a tsunami of content reflecting diverse voices and creative urges which has prompted reappraisal of what we previously understood about media consumption and production. In the bigger picture, the internet is a relatively recent phenomenon and the media forms and practices that preceded it still exist.\nThis course offers you the opportunity to critically engage with and theorise the media. In addition, you also create media by selecting one or more major. The degree is robust and provides an option of two majors if you wish to acquire further specialisations. You have the opportunity to produce a variety of media including: radio podcasts and broadcasts, non-fiction writing and journalism, interactive and trans-media web sites, documentaries, feature and drama productions and public relations campaigns. The course offers a sophisticated blend of media theory and production to ensure graduates are critical, enquiring, innovative, engaged and their learning is underpinned by current theoretical approaches and production skills.\nTaught by a staff of active researchers and media producers, you will learn and develop industry-grade skills using the on-site state-of-the-art production facilities. You will gain valuable industry experience through an internship placement as part of their academic studies.\nGraduates with a Bachelor of Media and Communications possess a skill base, tailored for the contemporary media ecology. Media convergence demands a different set of skills to those required in previous formulations. You will emerge with a range of critical skills and production specialisations reflecting a range of industry practices in which the contemporary media producer must be able to operate cross-platform.",

      "graduate_destinations_and_employability": "<p>Students are prepared for employment and further study through the disciplinary knowledge accumulated during the program as well as transferable skills in research, problem-solving and production. The course's capstone engages industry speakers (many of whom are leaders in their field) as well as academics on the topic of further studies and research. The internship and participation opportunities offered, further allow community engagement which helps shape students' future directions by providing industry experience and networking opportunities.<br />Bachelor of Media and Communications graduates are prepared for employment within the broad media industries. Examples of previous graduate destinations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Gamespot</li>\n<li>SBS (television and radio)</li>\n<li>The Australian</li>\n<li>Nine Entertainment</li>\n<li>ABC</li>\n<li>Val Morgan</li>\n<li>Loves Data</li>\n<li>Nova 96.1</li>\n<li>Universal Publications</li>\n<li>Nestl&eacute;</li>\n<li>Optus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While many graduates seek employment at the conclusion of their undergraduate studies, some feel compelled to undertake further studies in the form of either a professional postgraduate award or a high research degree. The department currently offers professional postgraduate awards such as the MA Creative Industries and MA International Media and Communications. The Bachelor of Media and Communications is designed to feed into these programs for students seeking practice-led further studies. For those considering a research pathway, the department offers the MRes and PhD programs. The Bachelor of Media and Communications scaffolds learning with an emphasis on critical enquiry and analysis giving students the opportunity to develop core academic and research skills.</p>",

The course is structured so that you engage in a set of required units while also being able to choose from a pool of related units designed to increase your overall understanding and to allow you to further specialise in particular areas. Within this structure you will be exposed to diverse teaching and learning approaches that are designed to be student-centred and flexible, providing opportunities to pursue a range of options oriented towards fitting your schedules. </p>\n<p>The teaching and learning approaches are designed to encourage creative and critical thinking about environmental and planning issues as well as a range of practical skills oriented towards professional development. Teaching and learning strategies include weekly workshops that typically involve a lecture accompanied by in-class activities involving peer-to-peer learning; block-mode teaching where teaching is condensed into extended blocks involving guest lectures and practical activities spread over two or three days; and field trips to research sites, to collect and analyse data and critically assess the impact of development on the environment. In each case staff work closely with students to ensure the best learning outcomes. The program mixes the knowledge and skills of academic staff with practicing professionals who play a prominent role in many of the teaching and learning activities.</p>\n<p>Within the course there is an emphasis on student directed learning through peer-to-peer interaction and discussion, drawing on the diverse skills and backgrounds of people within the class. Students are expected to research subjects outside class time and present that research via a variety of formats in class. Many units are aimed at developing professional teamwork skills and require students to work in small teams to generate and present ideas and research. There are also opportunities to apply skills and knowledge to practical 'real world' problems by producing research reports for public, private and community sector organisations.</p>\n<p>An important feature of the course is the major project in the capstone unit which provides students with the opportunity to undertake an applied research project or a work-integrated project (e.g. in government or industry), relevant to urban, social and environmental planning. These projects are designed to develop knowledge and skills.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Master of Planning is interdisciplinary and flexible degree aimed at preparing you for a variety of planning positions in the public and private sector. The degree is accredited by the Australian Institute of Planning and builds on the urban and environmental studies program that commenced in 1978. A key feature of the degree is its focus on sustainability and environmental issues and how these play out in strategic land use planning and assessment. The degree also enables you to pursue special interests in climate change, environmental management, sustainable development, urban and regional planning, environmental law and policy, social impact assessment, community consultation, spatial sciences and social change. The degree focuses on the development of skills that you will need as a practicing planner. The curriculum is based on lectures, workshops, tutorials and importantly field visits to ground theory to practice.</p>",

The majority of these are individual pieces of work oriented at developing the critical thinking, practical and communication skills. Assessments include writing essays and reports on contemporary environmental and planning topics; writing reviews and evaluations of current policies and approaches; and making presentations and participating in discussions with your peers. Other individual assessment tasks may include quizzes, exams, proposals, research projects, academic papers, critical reflections and the application of relevant skills. You will also be required to work in groups on assessment tasks that will reflect your knowledge, as well as teamwork and communication skills.</p>\n<p>Clear standards and criteria for coursework are included in the unit guide. Marking rubrics provided for specific assessment tasks to help students clarify what is expected. Feedback on submitted assignments takes a range of forms but will generally involve written notes regarding the strengths and weaknesses of your work as well as either quantitative or qualitative assessment in accordance to the assessment marking rubric. Teaching staff also provide feedback in-class or through personal appointments for further feedback and guidance. Constructive peer feedback may be sought for some assessment tasks, particularly those that require presentations. When conducting research for a public, private or community sector organisation as part of your training, feedback will also be sought from these entities. </p>",

The assessment includes a variety of written, presentation style and creative tasks designed to cater to a range of learning styles and strengths and to enhance existing skills.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are focused on application of discipline knowledge to professional practice in Indigenous Education settings, including researching and problem solving. Marking rubrics are given to students in advance of their assessments being due, to guide student expectation and learning. Core units require students to post written responses to weekly inquiry questions. These questions foster reflection and aim to integrate theory and practice, with a regular cycle of grade feedback and peer learning through open access to all student responses. Most assessment tasks encourage learners to apply developing theoretical knowledge and critical thinking skills, and judgement to their specific educational context. Assessment tasks focus student learning but are also designed to assess individual achievement against both unit level and course level learning outcomes.<br />A range of assessment tasks are utilised, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research essays&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Digital storytelling</li>\n<li>Presentations for professional, general and Indigenous community audiences,</li>\n<li>Short written tasks requiring exercise of judgement and application of knowledge</li>\n<li>Research proposals</li>\n<li>Online Quizzes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Written assessments encourage students to acquire, and further enhance their foundational knowledge as well to think critically about their Indigenous professional context and consider how to work effectively with Indigenous peoples and communities, in those contexts. The creative assessments (digital storytelling, ebook production for example) allow students to create resources for application in their classrooms, or other professional contexts, drawing on their theoretical knowledge but also fostering their growing sense of autonomy as advanced practitioners. Students in the final stages of the course develop a research proposal to address an issue they have identified from their own contexts. Learners peer review the proposal of one other student, and in turn receive peer feedback on their own proposal; an activity which requires students to evaluate, exercise judgement and consider their personal professional responsibility in relation to their classmate and the Indigenous community.</p>",

Material which, in a traditional law degree, would have been delivered by face to face lectures is now made available online and includes a mix of recorded audio and video content and links, as well as guided reading and self-assessment tasks There is an emphasis on self-directed and active learning, rather than on a model where the lecturer is responsible for delivery of all content. Through gradual development of skills of research, analysis and writing students are expected to become independent learners as is appropriate at post-graduate level. </p>\n<p>Face-to-face teaching in tutorials is offered to students either through weekly classes or through intensive on campus sessions comprising a 2 day block. The face to face tutorials are used to consolidate the learning that students have undertaken off-campus and to practice and apply their skills. Students are expected to attend tutorials prepared to answer and raise questions, interact with the tutor and with other students and, where appropriate, to make group or individual presentations. </p>\n<p>Collaboration and discussion of issues is encouraged both in and out of the classroom. Online learning and collaboration provides an inclusive environment for external students.</p>\n<p>The Department caters to a variety of learning styles and students will have the opportunity to learn through individual and collaborative study, discussion, debate, research, practical application, skills workshops, and self-directed methods.</p>\n<p>Each unit of the graduate certificate in law has an on-line website. Schedules of activities, readings, lectures, assessment tasks and other relevant information are uploaded onto the website.

Its role as a professional qualification dictates the inclusion of a substantial body of prescribed doctrinal content which, all law students need to master in order to be eligible to practice law in New South Wales. This body of prescribed content is found in the Legal Profession Admission Rules enacted by the New South Wales Parliament. The degree contains a mix of core, compulsory units which, for the most part, cover the prescribed material, and 6 electives.</p>\n<p>In addition to the development of doctrinal knowledge, the JD course aims to develop professional skills important in the practice of law. These include research, communication, time management, critical analysis and professional judgment. Personal attributes such as honesty, empathy and integrity are also stressed. Through the development of these skills and attributes graduates will become competent to assess current legal issues and also to make judgements about the role of, and need for law reform in the future in order to achieve social aims. </p>\n<p>The degree is delivered through a blended learning approach. Material which, in a traditional law degree, would have been delivered by face to face lectures is now made available online and includes a mix of recorded audio and video content and links, as well as guided reading and self-assessment tasks There is an emphasis on self-directed and active learning, rather than on a model where the lecturer is responsible for delivery of all content. Through gradual development of skills of research, analysis and writing students are expected to become independent learners as is appropriate at post-graduate level. </p>\n<p>Face to face teaching in tutorials is offered to students either through weekly classes or through intensive on campus sessions comprising a 2 day block The face to face tutorials are used to consolidate the learning that students have undertaken off-campus and to practice and apply their skills. Students are expected to attend tutorials prepared to answer and raise questions, interact with the tutor and with other students and, where appropriate to make group or individual presentations. </p>\n<p>Collaboration and discussion of issues is encouraged both in and out of the classroom. Online learning and collaboration provides an inclusive environment for external students.</p>\n<p>The Department caters to a variety of learning styles and students will have the opportunity to learn through individual and collaborative study, discussion, debate, research, practical application, skills workshops, and self-directed methods.</p>",

The JD continues the School's tradition of providing interdisciplinary perspectives on the study of law so that you can appreciate the role of law in its broader context through a historical, theoretical and practical study of law. The JD is offered through a flexible delivery model with substantial online content including lectures, readings, assessment tasks and other resources for guided learning. This will allow you to work in your own time and to take responsibility for your own learning. You may study full time or part time, on campus or externally (with on-campus block sessions). As well as equipping graduates to practice law, the JD focusses on the development of skills in research, communication, writing and problem solving.</p>",

The methods used across the course (not in every unit) may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online participation (incorporating directed discussion of questions set for each meeting or online forum) as well as individual and/or group presentations assess the integration of foundational knowledge and skills.</li>\n<li>Evidence-based analyses and essays test not only the integration of<br />foundational knowledge and skills, but also foster the creative application of historical skills and analysis of ancient cultures.</li>\n<li>Online Quizzes allow students to demonstrate their overall command of unit content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assessment tasks are carefully graduated to guide and focus engagement with the learning<br />outcomes. Carefully scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application. Modified development of content across assessments is also important to this course's methodology, with a view to systematic development of control over the learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>The assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. Online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based oral and/or written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency in this area. Textual, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context.</p>\n<p>Naturally enough, this assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The course deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview-assessments.</p>",

While 1000 level units provide an introduction to theoretical and practical components of musical learning in a contemporary context, 2000 level units provide students with options to undertake practical streams or to develop analytical skills. The 3000 level units build on musical learning, the 3000 level capstone unit provides students with opportunities to consolidate their learning. Throughout their candidature, Music students are able to engage in practical, theoretical and analytical unit content; they are encouraged to be creative thinkers able to work independently or in collaboration.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "The Bachelor of Music consolidates current strengths in Music by focusing on synergies across production and performance, including theoretical and practical study. Unlike other degrees offered, which adopt a more specialised approach, the Macquarie Bachelor of Music requires you to study performance and production. A unique feature of the degree is that entry does not require applicants to audition. This recognises the informal and formal learning pathways that typically lead you to undertake Music at tertiary level. The Bachelor of Music offers you a course that is focused on developing theoretical, practical and industry-focused skills, as well as musical training. This provides a point of difference to other Music degrees. The state of the art facilities and technologies available within the Bachelor of Music likewise are a unique offering. This course also offers breadth and depth of interdisciplinary study.",

Scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature, a quota of formal weighted tasks, and/or a final examination, encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application.</p>\n<p>The assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. In-class or online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based oral and/or written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency. Textual, linguistic, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical/archaeological/linguistic skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context. Final examinations provide a summative assessment of command over unit content.</p>\n<p>This assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The course deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview assessments.</p>",

The course is structured so that you engage in a set of required units while also being able to choose from a pool of related units designed to increase your overall understanding and to allow you to further specialise in particular areas. Within this structure you will be exposed to diverse teaching and learning approaches that are designed to be student-centred and flexible, providing opportunities to pursue a range of options oriented towards fitting your schedules.</p>\n<p>The teaching and learning approaches are designed to encourage creative and critical thinking about environmental and planning issues as well as a range of practical skills oriented towards professional development. Teaching and learning strategies include weekly workshops that typically involve a lecture accompanied by in-class activities involving peer-to-peer learning; block-mode teaching where teaching is condensed into extended blocks involving guest lectures and practical activities spread over two or three days; and field trips to collect and analyse data and critically assess the impact of development on the environment. In each case staff will work closely with students to ensure the best learning outcomes. The course mixes the knowledge and skills of academic staff with practicing professionals. This ensures teaching and learning activities are focused on applying theory to practice.</p>\n<p>Within the course there is an emphasis on student directed learning through peer-to-peer interaction and discussion, drawing on the diverse skills and backgrounds of people within the class. Students are expected to research subjects outside class time and present that research via a variety of formats in class. Many units are aimed at developing professional teamwork skills and require students to work in small teams to generate and present ideas and research. There are also opportunities to apply skills and knowledge to practical 'real world' problems by producing research reports for public, private and community sector organisations.</p>",

Students of the Bachelor of International Studies have opportunities to include in-country studies such as intensive residential units and PACE International activities in their degree in addition to a required semester of in-country study in country in which their target language is spoken.</p>\n<p>Learning and teaching International Studies content (non-language) units at the 1000 level incorporate a variety of methods and a range of subjects to enable students to develop knowledge and learn concepts of cross-cultural communication, and to identify, respect and respond appropriately to the norms of a broad range of cultures, and to apply these in program outcomes. Students have opportunities to undertake intensive residential in-country studies internship, a domestic internship and/or PACE International activity in their degree.</p>\n<p>Learning and teaching in 2000 and 3000 level Internationals Studies units facilitate independent research in topics such as citizenship studies, regional studies, intercultural communication, global politics and globalisation, identity, culture transition and transmission, and diaspora studies. At 3000 level, students in the Bachelor of International Studies undertaken a session of in-country studies where they apply their language skills towards social and academic purposes in an international context, and in the capstone unit they examine and reflect on the role of the target language in its cultural and societal setting, and evaluate this role in local and global situations.</p>\n<p>Language units undertaken as a core component of the Bachelor of International Studies use a communicative approach in the classroom environment with additional audio and written material and activities to be worked on at home. The emphasis inside and outside of the classroom is on meaningful interaction and tasks, and the creation of a low anxiety environment which fosters the development of a learning community in which students can practice their target language. This is supported by a range of comprehensible inputs targeted at the students' developing language level, both from teaching staff and support materials (principally online), and constant opportunities for students to apply their developing knowledge to meaningful tasks. These include reading and listening to authentic cultural materials, in which students are guided to develop comprehension strategies that can be applied to any situation, and to acquire vocabulary in context. In support of the communicative goals, students also review key grammatical concepts to build their confidence and capacity to evaluate their own progress in the discipline. As students' progress into 2000 and 3000 level units, they also engage in tasks and enrol in units with a stronger emphasis on cognitive and analytical skills in addition to language proficiency, including conducting research related to target language cultures and presenting it in a variety of formats such as oral presentations and written and spoken discussions, essays, debates, and audio-visual recordings. Language teaching models include: practicals, seminars, lectures, tutorials, and supervised independent study.</p>",

The diversity of assessment tasks strives to create a balance for students with different learning styles and opportunities for students to develop their skills across the learning areas of listening, reading, writing and speaking. Students are given multiple opportunities in each unit throughout the course to develop comprehension and communication strategies that will assist them in attaining the overall course learning outcomes. Assessment tasks require students to engage with theoretical concepts and express themselves appropriately according to the context and medium whether in their target language studies or in International Studies units. In the latter, students are required to undertake independent research and to demonstrate their knowledge, analytical skills and critical thinking.</p>\n<p>In addition students demonstrate their growing knowledge of the structural aspects of their target language and the cultural contexts in which communication occurs within the cultures which employ the target language. The emphasis is on formative tasks with meaningful applications, such as spoken and written tasks relating to students’ lives, opinions and their engagement with the broader language communities, however some summative tasks such as grammar and vocabulary quizzes are incorporated, particularly at 1000 and 2000 levels, so that students can confirm minimum attainment of key structural aspects of the language. All student work is evaluated according to standards that are clearly articulated within the unit, and no norm-referencing is used. International Studies units employ moderation procedures between multiple markers involved in a single unit and external moderation for units with a single marker.</p>\n<p>Examples of assessment types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quiz</li>\n<li>Essay</li>\n<li>Online discussion – written</li>\n<li>Participation</li>\n<li>Literature review</li>\n<li>Presentation</li>\n<li>Formal Exams</li>\n</ul>",

The methods used across the program (not in every<br />unit) may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tests on ancient language grammar and syntax assess foundational knowledge and skills.</li>\n<li>Formal tutorial participation (incorporating directed discussion of questions set for each meeting or online forum) as well as individual and/or group presentations assess the integration of foundational knowledge and skills.</li>\n<li>Evidence-based analyses and essays test not only the integration of<br />foundational knowledge and skills, but also foster the creative application of historical skills and analysis of ancient cultures.</li>\n<li>Final examinations allow students to demonstrate their overall command of unit content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assessment tasks are carefully graduated to guide and focus engagement with the learning<br />outcomes. Carefully scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature (including low-risk activities, encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application. Modified development of content across assessments is also important to this program's methodology, with a view to systematic development of control over the learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>The assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. In-class or online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based oral and/or written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency in this area. Textual, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context. Final examinations are not normally required: they may be utilized (eg in language units) to provide a summative assessment of command over unit content.</p>\n<p>Naturally enough, this assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The program deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview-assessments.</p>",

In keeping with Macquarie University's vision to promote research-intensive learning and teaching, critical, analytical and integrative thinking skills are incorporated into all units in this degree. Course content draws on contemporary research-based expertise in child development, curriculum and pedagogy, and leadership and management. Students apply their understandings, skills and specialist early childhood knowledge through engagement with children across the birth to five years range in a variety of early childhood environments. As a postgraduate course, upon successful completion of this degree, it is expected that graduates will be ready to work as ethical, autonomous and critically reflective teacher leaders, capable of working effectively with children, parents and other professionals in their local communities.</p>",

      "graduate_destinations_and_employability": "<p>The Master of Teaching (Birth to Five years) degree is designed to enable graduates from diverse disciplines or professions to obtain an approved early childhood teacher qualification. This degree aligns well with the increasing professionalisation of the early childhood sector and the growing demand for early childhood educators with university qualifications. It will support students to develop practical teaching skills underpinned by a sound multidisciplinary knowledge base of early childhood studies, essential for employment and career growth as an early childhood specialist. All students complete three practicum placements in early childhood settings with children in the birth to five years age range. In particular, during ECHE8290 - the internship unit, students are scaffolded to demonstrate their capacity to work at an advanced level expected of early childhood teachers with a masters degree qualification.</p>\n<p>Upon successful completion, graduates from this degree can seek employment with a range of government agencies, non-government organisations as well as private and community owned early childhood settings, based within Australia or overseas. High performing graduates can also gain access to Macquarie University's higher degree research training course, the Master of Research.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The study of International Relations is based on critique and reflection as a basis for action. Its subject matter is inherently contested: thinkers across the ages and practitioners in the current age have conflicting views of what is possible and desirable in relations between states and peoples. Learning in the course is designed to promote a deep understanding of conflicting perspectives and abilities to espouse and, as far as possible, execute choices that are rational, ethical, and effective in a world of conflict.</p>\n<p>The activities that students undertake in the course are related to the thoughts and actions of others. Reading diverse materials in many different formats, interaction with faculty and peers, both digitally and face-to-face, and observation are activities that feed reflection. Active engagement with faculty and peers is equally promoted in online and on-campus lectures and in other interactive modes that allow questions and testing in modes that may involve two or many other people. Methods employed include discussion, both structured and spontaneous (under moderation), debate, simulations and role play, panel decision-making, journalling and peer review and feedback. In seminars and fieldwork exercises, student engagement is essential for structured discussion and the collaborative consideration of the core principles and points of contention in international relations.</p>\n<p>Students in the course typically come from very diverse nationalities and cross-learning is critically important, in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. The course treats students as adult learners who are mastering the techniques of study, analysis and argumentative deployment through reflexivity and praxis: an individual&rsquo;s sense of capacity is developed in relation to the values of others and tested in interaction with them, some as individuals directly experienced (staff, guest lecturers, peers) and others as found in the texts and debates, both historical and current, of the global arena.</p>\n<p>Learning and teaching strategies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Openness to a variety of teaching and assessment formats that engage diverse learning styles and encourage student participation, discussion, and collaboration.</li>\n<li>Timely feedback on all assignments and where necessary individual tuition to address assessed weaknesses in performance.</li>\n<li>An emphasis on elucidating the ethical dimensions of decision making in the world of global politics, drawing conclusions as appropriate for new or differing approaches to policy making and execution in international relations.</li>\n<li>The use of case studies drawn from historical and contemporary times that illuminate key themes in the emerging global society.</li>\n<li>Where possible, attendance or observation of significant incidents in thinking about international relations, as in seminars off campus by visiting scholars, activists and elected officials from national governments and international organisations.</li>\n<li>Lectures: lectures are delivered face to face in day and evening mode and also digitally and may be in one or two hour format or in shorter sessions interspersed with discussion and structured analysis. Faculty members deliver most lectures, but guest lecturers cover some topics where specialist expertise is required.</li>\n<li>Seminars: seminars allow for the interactive discussion of topics at an enhanced level and may include attendance and participation in seminars beyond the formal reach of the course, as in work in progress seminars by faculty members and visiting scholars.</li>\n<li>Learning technologies: throughout all activities of the course, attention is paid to the introduction of new or modified learning technologies based on the University&rsquo;s strong commitment to the ongoing learning of its own faculty as reflected in the professional development programs offered on campus every year. Recent modifications include the intensification of the &lsquo;flipped classroom&rsquo; mode and the use of video in on-line delivery.</li>\n</ul>",

The assessment process in this course encourages regular, systematic learning of course content and skills, rewards independent, critical and evidence-based thinking and nurtures the ability to synthesise complex information, theories and educational practice.</p>\n<p>Examples of assessment include but are not limited to: reflections on learning, critical analysis of professional reading and research, discussions and web forums, evaluative responses to curriculum and policy documents, plans for and critique of teaching and learning sequences, multi-modal presentations, observations, digital portfolios, viva voces, case studies. The culminating assessment will be aTeaching Performance Assessment (TPA) which is a practice-based research project undertaken as a NESA accreditation requirement undertaken during the final period of professional experience.</p>",

General Coursework Rule 9b(ii) stipulates if a student fails a clinical or professional unit which is required for their enrolled program of study, then they may be excluded from further enrolment in that program of study.  Students completing a combined Bachelor degree will be able to continue with their other degree program provided they meet the academic progression requirements of the Academic Progression Policy.</p>"

The methods used across the program (not in every<br />unit) may be summarized as follows:<br />• Tests on ancient language grammar and syntax assess foundational knowledge and skills.<br />• Online tutorial participation (incorporating directed discussion of questions set for online forum) as well as individual and/or group presentations assess the integration of foundational knowledge and skills.<br />• Evidence-based analyses and essays test not only the integration of<br />foundational knowledge and skills, but also foster the creative application of historical skills and analysis of ancient cultures.<br />• Final examinations allow students to demonstrate their overall command of unit content.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks are carefully graduated to guide and focus engagement with the learning<br />outcomes. Carefully scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature (including low-risk activities, encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application. Modified development of content across assessments is also important to this program's methodology, with a view to systematic development of control over the learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>The assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. Online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency in this area. Textual, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context. Final examinations are not normally required: they may be utilized (eg in language units) to provide a summative assessment of command over unit content.</p>\n<p>Naturally enough, this assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The program deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview-assessments.</p>",

The methods used across the course (not in every unit) may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online participation (incorporating directed discussion of questions set for each online forum) as well as individual and/or group presentations assess the integration of foundational knowledge and skills.</li>\n<li>Evidence-based analyses and essays test not only the integration of<br />foundational knowledge and skills, but also foster the creative application of historical skills and analysis of ancient cultures.</li>\n<li>Online Quizzes allow students to demonstrate their overall command of unit content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assessment tasks are carefully graduated to guide and focus engagement with the learning<br />outcomes. Carefully scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application. Modified development of content across assessments is also important to this course's methodology, with a view to systematic development of control over the learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>The assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. Online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency in this area. Textual, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context.</p>\n<p>Naturally enough, this assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The course deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview-assessments.</p>",

Course content draws on contemporary research-based expertise in child development, curriculum and pedagogy, and leadership and management. Students apply their understandings, skills and specialist early childhood knowledge through engagement with children across the birth to five years range in a variety of early childhood environments. As a postgraduate degree, upon successful completion of this degree, it is expected that graduates will be ready to work as ethical, autonomous and critically reflective teacher leaders, capable of working effectively with children, parents and other professionals in their local communities.</p>\n<p>Master of Teaching (Birth to Five Years) (OUA) students will be qualified with the award of Master of Teaching (Birth to Five Years).</p>",

All students complete three practicum placements in early childhood settings with children in the birth to five years age range. In particular, during ECED829 – the internship unit, students are scaffolded to demonstrate their capacity to work at an advanced level expected of early childhood teachers with a masters degree qualification.</p>\n<p>Upon successful completion, graduates from this degree can seek employment with a range of government agencies, non-government organisations as well as private and community owned early childhood settings, based within Australia or overseas. High performing graduates can also gain access to Macquarie University's higher degree research training course, the Master of Research.</p>",

Typical assessments in the majors and minors will include essays and online and in-class quizzes, individual and group projects and multi-media presentations e.g. posters, videos, blogs. Formal examinations may be part of the assessment in some units. Course-based assessment will be introduced in the foundation units using a set of capability statements and an e-portfolio. This will include reflective essays, learning logs, memos. Throughout the course you will be provided with milestones/opportunities to receive formative feedback on the development of your e-portfolio. For example, you will be asked to submit mini reflections on the performance in particular assessments in your majors or write some action plans about how to improve your performance in some of the capabilities. Your final e-portfolio will be summatively assessed by a panel of academics and industry partners in the third year as the largest piece of assessment in your Capstone Unit. This will include the submission of a complete portfolio and a presentation.</p>",

The emphasis inside and outside of the classroom is on meaningful interaction and tasks, and the creation of a low anxiety environment which fosters the development of a learning community in which students can practice their chosen language and discuss the culture and communities that utilise the language. This is supported by a range of comprehensible inputs targeted at the students’ developing language level, both from teaching staff and support materials (principally online), and opportunities for students to apply their developing knowledge to meaningful tasks. These include reading and listening to authentic cultural materials, in which students are guided to develop comprehension strategies that can be applied to any situation, and to acquire vocabulary in context.</p>\n<p>In support of the communicative goals, students also review key grammatical concepts to build their confidence and capacity to evaluate their own progress in the discipline. As students’ progress into 2000 and 3000 level units, they also engage in tasks and enrol in units with a stronger emphasis on cognitive and analytical skills in addition to language proficiency, including closely supervised research, presenting it in a variety of formats such as oral presentations and written and spoken discussions, essays, debates, and audio-visual recordings. Teaching models include: practicals, seminars, lectures, tutorials, and supervised independent study.

The diversity of assessment tasks strives to create a balance for students with different learning styles and opportunities for students to develop their skills across the four language learning areas of listening, reading, writing and speaking. Students are given multiple opportunities in each unit throughout the Diploma to develop comprehension and communication strategies that will assist them in attaining the overall program learning outcomes. Depending on their language proficiency and the level of the unit, assessment tasks require students to engage with speech and writing in the relevant language and express themselves appropriately according to the context and medium, while demonstrating their growing knowledge of the structural aspects of the language and the cultural contexts in which communication occurs. The emphasis is on formative tasks with meaningful applications, such as spoken and written tasks relating to students’ lives, opinions and their engagement with the world of their chosen language, however some summative tasks such as grammar and vocabulary quizzes and exams are incorporated, particularly at 1000 and 2000 levels, so that students can confirm minimum attainment of key structural aspects of the language. All student work is evaluated according to standards that are clearly articulated within the unit. The Diploma of Languages (Chinese) employs moderation procedures between multiple markers involved in a single unit and some external moderation, and incorporates some machine-marked activities.</p>\n<p>Examples of assessment types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>quiz</li>\n<li>oral assignment – individual and group (e.g. advertisements, dialogues, monologues, interviews)</li>\n<li>written composition</li>\n<li>written examination</li>\n<li>oral examination</li>\n<li>debate</li>\n<li>essay</li>\n<li>video/audio recording</li>\n<li>online discussion – written and spoken</li>\n<li>review</li>\n<li>editorial</li>\n<li>participation</li>\n<li>homework (e.g. grammar exercises, reading and listening comprehension)</li>\n<li>literature review</li>\n<li>presentation</li>\n</ul>",

The emphasis inside and outside of the classroom is on meaningful interaction and tasks, and the creation of a low anxiety environment which fosters the development of a learning community in which students can practice their chosen language and discuss the culture and communities that utilise the language. This is supported by a range of comprehensible inputs targeted at the students’ developing language level, both from teaching staff and support materials (principally online), and opportunities for students to apply their developing knowledge to meaningful tasks. These include reading and listening to authentic cultural materials, in which students are guided to develop comprehension strategies that can be applied to any situation, and to acquire vocabulary in context.</p>\n<p>In support of the communicative goals, students also review key grammatical concepts to build their confidence and capacity to evaluate their own progress in the discipline. As students’ progress into 2000 and 3000 level units, they also engage in tasks and enrol in units with a stronger emphasis on cognitive and analytical skills in addition to language proficiency, including closely supervised research, presenting it in a variety of formats such as oral presentations and written and spoken discussions, essays, debates, and audio-visual recordings. Teaching models include: practicals, seminars, lectures, tutorials, and supervised independent study.

The diversity of assessment tasks strives to create a balance for students with different learning styles and opportunities for students to develop their skills across the four language learning areas of listening, reading, writing and speaking. Students are given multiple opportunities in each unit throughout the Diploma to develop comprehension and communication strategies that will assist them in attaining the overall program learning outcomes. Depending on their language proficiency and the level of the unit, assessment tasks require students to engage with speech and writing in the relevant language and express themselves appropriately according to the context and medium, while demonstrating their growing knowledge of the structural aspects of the language and the cultural contexts in which communication occurs. The emphasis is on formative tasks with meaningful applications, such as spoken and written tasks relating to students’ lives, opinions and their engagement with the world of their chosen language, however some summative tasks such as grammar and vocabulary quizzes and exams are incorporated, particularly at 1000 and 2000 levels, so that students can confirm minimum attainment of key structural aspects of the language. All student work is evaluated according to standards that are clearly articulated within the unit. The Diploma of Languages (French) employs moderation procedures between multiple markers involved in a single unit and some external moderation, and incorporates some machine-marked activities.</p>\n<p>Examples of assessment types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>quiz</li>\n<li>oral assignment – individual and group (e.g. advertisements, dialogues, monologues, interviews)</li>\n<li>written composition</li>\n<li>written examination</li>\n<li>oral examination</li>\n<li>debate</li>\n<li>essay</li>\n<li>video/audio recording</li>\n<li>online discussion – written and spoken</li>\n<li>review</li>\n<li>editorial</li>\n<li>participation</li>\n<li>homework (e.g. grammar exercises, reading and listening comprehension)</li>\n<li>literature review</li>\n<li>presentation</li>\n</ul>",

The emphasis inside and outside of the classroom is on meaningful interaction and tasks, and the creation of a low anxiety environment which fosters the development of a learning community in which students can practice their chosen language and discuss the culture and communities that utilise the language. This is supported by a range of comprehensible inputs targeted at the students’ developing language level, both from teaching staff and support materials (principally online), and opportunities for students to apply their developing knowledge to meaningful tasks. These include reading and listening to authentic cultural materials, in which students are guided to develop comprehension strategies that can be applied to any situation, and to acquire vocabulary in context.</p>\n<p>In support of the communicative goals, students also review key grammatical concepts to build their confidence and capacity to evaluate their own progress in the discipline. As students’ progress into 2000 and 3000 level units, they also engage in tasks and enrol in units with a stronger emphasis on cognitive and analytical skills in addition to language proficiency, including closely supervised research, presenting it in a variety of formats such as oral presentations and written and spoken discussions, essays, debates, and audio-visual recordings. Teaching models include: practicals, seminars, lectures, tutorials, and supervised independent study. Students have opportunities to include in-country studies such as intensive residential units in their degree.</p>",

The diversity of assessment tasks strives to create a balance for students with different learning styles and opportunities for students to develop their skills across the four language learning areas of listening, reading, writing and speaking. Students are given multiple opportunities in each unit throughout the Diploma to develop comprehension and communication strategies that will assist them in attaining the overall program learning outcomes. Depending on their language proficiency and the level of the unit, assessment tasks require students to engage with speech and writing in the relevant language and express themselves appropriately according to the context and medium, while demonstrating their growing knowledge of the structural aspects of the language and the cultural contexts in which communication occurs. The emphasis is on formative tasks with meaningful applications, such as spoken and written tasks relating to students’ lives, opinions and their engagement with the world of their chosen language, however some summative tasks such as grammar and vocabulary quizzes and exams are incorporated, particularly at 1000 and 2000 levels, so that students can confirm minimum attainment of key structural aspects of the language. All student work is evaluated according to standards that are clearly articulated within the unit. The Diploma of Languages (German) employs moderation procedures between multiple markers involved in a single unit and some external moderation, and incorporates some machine-marked activities.</p>\n<p>Examples of assessment types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>quiz</li>\n<li>oral assignment – individual and group (e.g. advertisements, dialogues, monologues, interviews)</li>\n<li>written composition</li>\n<li>written examination</li>\n<li>oral examination</li>\n<li>debate</li>\n<li>essay</li>\n<li>video/audio recording</li>\n<li>online discussion – written and spoken</li>\n<li>review</li>\n<li>editorial</li>\n<li>participation</li>\n<li>homework (e.g. grammar exercises, reading and listening comprehension)</li>\n<li>literature review</li>\n<li>presentation</li>\n</ul>",

The emphasis inside and outside of the classroom is on meaningful interaction and tasks, and the creation of a low anxiety environment which fosters the development of a learning community in which students can practice their chosen language and discuss the culture and communities that utilise the language. This is supported by a range of comprehensible inputs targeted at the students’ developing language level, both from teaching staff and support materials (principally online), and opportunities for students to apply their developing knowledge to meaningful tasks. These include reading and listening to authentic cultural materials, in which students are guided to develop comprehension strategies that can be applied to any situation, and to acquire vocabulary in context.</p>\n<p>In support of the communicative goals, students also review key grammatical concepts to build their confidence and capacity to evaluate their own progress in the discipline. As students’ progress into 2000 and 3000 level units, they also engage in tasks and enrol in units with a stronger emphasis on cognitive and analytical skills in addition to language proficiency, including closely supervised research, presenting it in a variety of formats such as oral presentations and written and spoken discussions, essays, debates, and audio-visual recordings. Teaching models include: practicals, seminars, lectures, tutorials, and supervised independent study. Students have opportunities to include in-country studies such as intensive residential units in their degree.</p>",

Students completing a Diploma of Languages (Japanese) enhance their other academic and professional skills and prepare for the multilingual global environment through increasing proficiency in the language of study. They gain an understanding of the society and culture of the countries where the language is spoken. Students learn about cultural differences, analyse the relationship between language and culture, and recognise the importance of cross-cultural communication. The Macquarie University Diploma of Languages (Japanese) has a distinctive cross-cultural approach and includes opportunities for innovative modes of learning including online delivery and residential units in a country where the language is spoken.</p>",

      "assessment": "<p>Assessment is based on a progressive continuous assessment model, which ensures compliance with Macquarie’s policy. The diversity of assessment tasks strives to create a balance for students with different learning styles and opportunities for students to develop their skills across the four language learning areas of listening, reading, writing and speaking. Students are given multiple opportunities in each unit throughout the Diploma to develop comprehension and communication strategies that will assist them in attaining the overall program learning outcomes. Depending on their language proficiency and the level of the unit, assessment tasks require students to engage with speech and writing in the relevant language and express themselves appropriately according to the context and medium, while demonstrating their growing knowledge of the structural aspects of the language and the cultural contexts in which communication occurs. The emphasis is on formative tasks with meaningful applications, such as spoken and written tasks relating to students’ lives, opinions and their engagement with the world of their chosen language, however some summative tasks such as grammar and vocabulary quizzes and exams are incorporated, particularly at 1000 and 2000 levels, so that students can confirm minimum attainment of key structural aspects of the language. All student work is evaluated according to standards that are clearly articulated within the unit. The Diploma of Languages (Japanese) employs moderation procedures between multiple markers involved in a single unit and some external moderation, and incorporates some machine-marked activities.</p>\n<p>Examples of assessment types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>quiz</li>\n<li>oral assignment – individual and group (e.g. advertisements, dialogues, monologues, interviews)</li>\n<li>written composition</li>\n<li>written examination</li>\n<li>oral examination</li>\n<li>debate</li>\n<li>essay</li>\n<li>video/audio recording</li>\n<li>online discussion – written and spoken</li>\n<li>review</li>\n<li>editorial</li>\n<li>participation</li>\n<li>homework (e.g. grammar exercises, reading and listening comprehension)</li>\n<li>literature review</li>\n<li>presentation</li>\n</ul>",

The emphasis inside and outside of the classroom is on meaningful interaction and tasks, and the creation of a low anxiety environment which fosters the development of a learning community in which students can practice their chosen language and discuss the culture and communities that utilise the language. This is supported by a range of comprehensible inputs targeted at the students’ developing language level, both from teaching staff and support materials (principally online), and opportunities for students to apply their developing knowledge to meaningful tasks. These include reading and listening to authentic cultural materials, in which students are guided to develop comprehension strategies that can be applied to any situation, and to acquire vocabulary in context.</p>\n<p>In support of the communicative goals, students also review key grammatical concepts to build their confidence and capacity to evaluate their own progress in the discipline. As students’ progress into 2000 and 3000 level units, they also engage in tasks and enrol in units with a stronger emphasis on cognitive and analytical skills in addition to language proficiency, including closely supervised research, presenting it in a variety of formats such as oral presentations and written and spoken discussions, essays, debates, and audio-visual recordings. Teaching models include: practicals, seminars, lectures, tutorials, and supervised independent study. Students have opportunities to include in-country studies such as intensive residential units in their degree.</p>",

They gain an understanding of the society and culture of the countries where the language is spoken. Students learn about cultural differences, analyse the relationship between language and culture, and recognise the importance of cross-cultural communication. The Macquarie University Diploma of Languages (Spanish) has a distinctive cross-cultural approach and includes opportunities for innovative modes of learning including online delivery and residential units in a country where the language is spoken.</p>",

      "assessment": "<p>Assessment is based on a progressive continuous assessment model, which ensures compliance with Macquarie’s policy. The diversity of assessment tasks strives to create a balance for students with different learning styles and opportunities for students to develop their skills across the four language learning areas of listening, reading, writing and speaking. Students are given multiple opportunities in each unit throughout the Diploma to develop comprehension and communication strategies that will assist them in attaining the overall program learning outcomes. Depending on their language proficiency and the level of the unit, assessment tasks require students to engage with speech and writing in the relevant language and express themselves appropriately according to the context and medium, while demonstrating their growing knowledge of the structural aspects of the language and the cultural contexts in which communication occurs. The emphasis is on formative tasks with meaningful applications, such as spoken and written tasks relating to students’ lives, opinions and their engagement with the world of their chosen language, however some summative tasks such as grammar and vocabulary quizzes and exams are incorporated, particularly at 1000 and 2000 levels, so that students can confirm minimum attainment of key structural aspects of the language. All student work is evaluated according to standards that are clearly articulated within the unit. The Diploma of Languages (Spanish) employs moderation procedures between multiple markers involved in a single unit and some external moderation, and incorporates some machine-marked activities.</p>\n<p>Examples of assessment types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>quiz</li>\n<li>oral assignment – individual and group (e.g. advertisements, dialogues, monologues, interviews)</li>\n<li>written composition</li>\n<li>written examination</li>\n<li>oral examination</li>\n<li>debate</li>\n<li>essay</li>\n<li>video/audio recording</li>\n<li>online discussion – written and spoken</li>\n<li>review</li>\n<li>editorial</li>\n<li>participation</li>\n<li>homework (e.g. grammar exercises, reading and listening comprehension)</li>\n<li>literature review</li>\n<li>presentation</li>\n</ul>",

Students will engage with and critically reflect on contemporary research and apply theoretical learning to practice through developing resources and pedagogies that actively value students in all their diversities. A key focus will be on identifying barriers to education for many students, including common misunderstandings, and the impact of a range of social, cultural, political, economic, and environmental factors and develop strategies for addressing these barriers.  Students will apply research principles to a small-scale project. The course incorporates flexible modes of delivery and is particularly suited to part-time study for practising professionals. Professional experience is an integral part of the course. All students complete two professional experience (practicum) placements.</p>\n<p>Throughout this course you will be encouraged to build on your existing skills and knowledge in general education or therapy practice. You will develop and generalize both practical skills and capabilities in, and a deep knowledge and understanding of, the design and selection of curriculum, teaching and assessment strategies for learners with special education needs. Your skills will be underpinned by a growing appreciation of and familiarity with the research base for evidence-based special education pedagogy. As you progress through the course, you will hone your ability to critically evaluate research evidence and to make expert, ethical, and responsible professional judgements.</p>\n<p>You will be provided with on-line seminars that will include the presentation of course content, with video recordings of students in real settings. Seminars include individual and collaborative small group activities to enable you to receive feedback as you practice essential skills and build a deep understanding of the principles of effective pedagogy for students with special education needs. You will be provided with readings to build in-depth understanding of research and issues in special education. You will participate in on-line discussion with your peers to refine your skills and understanding and to exchange views on current policies and practices in special education and the application of current research literature. On-line quizzes will be available for you to monitor your own learning.</p>\n<p>You will have the opportunity to put theory in to practice during supervised professional experience placements linked to key units and through planning and implementing an intervention as part of the capstone unit. Your understanding of research in special education will be developed throughout the course, and more particularly through the research-focused units where you will hear active researchers present on their work.</p>\n<p>All assessment tasks will require you to demonstrate an understanding of principles and an ability to analyse and synthesize complex ideas and concepts to problem-solve across a range of hypothetical and real scenarios. You will have the opportunity to complete a literature review in the form of a submission-ready journal article on a topic of your choice and to make presentations to your peers.</p>",

Both the progressive nature of assessment, and the structure of most of the assessment tasks is designed to encourage you to view the assessment as a learning experience as well as providing unit staff with an indication of your understanding of key concepts central to the practice of special education.</p>\n<p>For this purpose, problem solving exercises are employed. In addition, professional experience provides supervised opportunities where you can demonstrate your efficacy in applying concepts addressed in the course to teaching practice as well as demonstrate appropriate professional and ethical behaviour. A variety of assignment formats are employed to allow you to develop and demonstrate your critical analysis skills. At the end of the course, the intervention program design allows you to demonstrate your ability to apply research findings to your lived teaching practice. A number of presentations allow you to demonstrate your ability to effectively communicate with peers. As this is a level 9 program, the Research project provides you with the opportunity to develop and apply research skills to a problem of education significance.</p>",

Students will engage with and critically reflect on contemporary research and apply theoretical learning to practice through developing resources and pedagogies that actively value students in all their diversities. A key focus will be on identifying barriers to education for many students, including common misunderstandings, and the impact of a range of social, cultural, political, economic, and environmental factors and develop strategies for addressing these barriers. The course incorporates flexible modes of delivery and is particularly suited to part-time study for practising professionals. Professional experience is an integral part of the course. All students complete two professional experience (practicum) placements.</p>\n<p>Throughout this course you will be encouraged to build on your existing skills and knowledge in general education or therapy practice. You will develop both practical skills and capabilities in, and knowledge and advanced understanding of, the design and selection of curriculum, teaching and assessment strategies for learners with special education needs. As the course progresses you will develop an understanding of research-based practice in special education and the ability to make high-level educational decisions and generate solutions to complex educational problems.</p>\n<p>You will be provided with live or on-line seminars that will include the presentation of course content, with video recordings of students in real settings. Seminars include individual and collaborative small group activities to enable you to receive feedback as you practice essential skills and build an understanding of the principles of effective pedagogy for students with special education needs. You will be provided with readings to build your understanding of research-based practice in special education. You will participate in on-line discussion with your peers to refine your skills and understanding and to exchange views on current policies and practices in special education.

You will develop both practical skills and capabilities in, and knowledge and an understanding of, the design and selection of curriculum, teaching and assessment strategies, particularly for students with problem behaviour. You will develop specific expertise in the selection and design of practices to improve student behaviour and general classroom management. As the course progresses you will develop an awareness of evidence-based practice, particularly related to students with problem behaviour.</p>\n<p>You will be provided with live or on-line seminars that will include the presentation of course content, with video recordings of students in real settings. Seminars include individual and collaborative small group activities to enable you to receive feedback as you practise essential skills and build an understanding of the principles of effective pedagogy, particularly for students with behaviour problems. You will be provided with readings to build your awareness of research-based practice for students with problem behaviour. You will participate in on-line discussion with your peers to refine your skills and understanding and to exchange views on general special education practices and practices particularly for students with problem behaviour. On-line quizzes will be available for you to monitor your own learning.</p>\n<p>You will have the opportunity to put theory in to practice during supervised professional experience placements linked to key units. Your experiences in these units will build your capacity to communicate about special education policy and practices, particularly in the area of problem behaviour and classroom management to a variety of audiences including your peers, families, other teachers and teacher assistants.</p>\n<p>All assessment tasks will require you to demonstrate an understanding of principles and an ability to review, analyse, consolidate and synthesise knowledge relevant to professional practice for students with special education needs and specifically for those with problem behaviour in order to problem-solve across a range of hypothetical and real scenarios.</p>",

This coursework will involve the content and assessment tasks set in the core social science units and elective units. Unit guides for each coursework unit contain a clear outline of assessment standards and criteria, including what is to be assessed and how this will be done. In this course, your assessments will take a variety of forms, including: academic essays, planning tools, critical reflections, literature reviews, research proposals, and/or research reports.</p>\n<p>Coursework is designed to develop your communicative, personal and professional capabilities. The core social science units will give you the opportunity to consider applications of a wide range of methods and analytic tools that are used to collect, assess and communicate information from multiple sources. You will also engage with qualitative and quantitative approaches relevant to disciplinary and interdisciplinary research in the social sciences. And, you will explore a range of theoretical and analytical tools to understand policy practice and development. The course culminates in a professional social research project, in which you will apply social science skills during on-the-job practical experience. Research placements are organised on-site with a wide range of research organisations, such as government agencies, nongovernment organisations, research centres, and universities.</p>\n<p>During the course, you will receive formative and summative feedback. Formative feedback is provided to students as an assessment is being undertaken, while summative feedback is provided after completion of an assessment. These kinds of feedback both aim to assist you in developing key capabilities relevant to social science practice. Feedback provided may involve written commentary from, or oral discussions with, teaching staff, on-site research project supervisors, and peers. Feedback from on-site research project supervisors will focus on vocational skills, including self-management, communication skills, and organisational skills.</p>",

General Coursework Rule 9b(ii) stipulates if a student fails a clinical or professional unit which is required for their enrolled program of study, then they may be excluded from further enrolment in that program of study.  Students completing a combined Bachelor degree will be able to continue with their other degree program provided they meet the academic progression requirements of the Academic Progression Policy.</p>"
