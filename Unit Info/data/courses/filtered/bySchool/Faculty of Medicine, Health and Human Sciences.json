      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "Psychology is a broad discipline, and the range of units offered in this program reflects that breadth. Over the three years of this course students will be exposed to all the major areas of psychological study, from the most fundamental brain research through to social issues such as the causes of intergroup conflict. The learning and teaching methods employed throughout the program also reflect this breadth, from laboratory-based practical work through to sophisticated, reflective field-work, as represented in the 3rd-year Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) unit. The overarching pedagogical approach throughout the program is student-centred learning, with an emphasis, not simply on the acquisition of discipline knowledge, but also on the development of higher-order critical thinking and problem-solving approaches to a range of psychological processes and issues. Although units differ with respect to formal or recorded lecture offerings, there is a focus in every unit on small-group learning through laboratory practicals and/or tutorial exercises and discussions. Students are also encouraged to engage with iLearn discussions of lecture and tutorial material, and to test the development of their own understanding via online tests and quizzes. First-year psychology students are also required to participate in Departmental research projects in order to learn how research is conducted and to encourage interaction with more senior scholars in the field.",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "Psychology is a discipline characterised by both scientific research and applied professional practice. This degree is concerned with providing students with a scientific understanding in the psychological processes that underlie behaviour including perception, cognition, learning, motivation, neuroscience, psychopathology, personality, emotion, developmental psychology, health psychology, counselling and social relationships, as well as training in the analysis of data and research methodologies. This course allows students to complete an accredited Psychology degree across three years.  Students in this course also have the option to transfer to the Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) course to complete an additional fourth year of honours in Psychology, conditional on meeting the entry requirements. A key feature of the Bachelor of Psychology degree is the capstone unit, which aims to provide students with skills to facilitate their transfer into the workplace, and the opportunity to gain limited but relevant experience working in the field.",

Over the four years of the course, students will be exposed to all the major areas of psychological study, from the most fundamental brain research through to social issues such as the causes of intergroup conflict. The fourth year also offers a range of advanced coursework options (including professional units on counselling and ethics), along with the requirement for students to plan, conduct, and report a substantial independent research project under the supervision of a staff member. Overall, the learning and teaching methods employed throughout the course reflect the breadth of the program and range from laboratory-based practical work through to sophisticated, reflective field-work, as represented in our 3rd-year Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) unit. The overarching pedagogical approach throughout the course is student-centred learning, with an emphasis, not simply on the acquisition of discipline knowledge, but also on the development of higher-order critical thinking and problem-solving approaches to a range of psychological processes and issues. Although units differ with respect to formal lecture offerings (including recorded lectures), there is a focus in every unit on small-group learning through laboratory practicals and/or tutorial exercises and discussions. Students are also encouraged to engage with iLearn discussions of lecture and tutorial material, and to test the development of their own understanding via online tests and quizzes. First-year psychology students are required to participate in Departmental research projects in order to learn how research is conducted and to encourage interaction with more senior scholars in the field.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Honours degree of Bachelor of Psychology is our principal degree intended for high-achieving students aiming for a professional career in Psychology. It is a four-year accredited degree in Psychology. Students may transfer to this degree from the 3-year Bachelor of Psychology, upon meeting entry requirements. Psychology is a discipline involving both scientific research and applied professional practice. The first three years of this degree are concerned with equipping students with a scientific understanding of the psychological processes that underlie behaviour including perception, cognition, learning, motivation, neuroscience, psychopathology, personality, emotion, developmental psychology, health psychology, counselling and social relationships, as well as training in the analysis of data and research methodologies. Admission to the honours (fourth) year of this course will be determined entirely by academic merit. In this final year students will plan and engage in an independent and sustained critical investigation and evaluation of a chosen research topic that will match their strengths and career interests.</p>",

Students learn how to apply their growing knowledge through a sequence of integrated, body systems-oriented units where pathophysiology and intervention is taught alongside normal anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. A parallel sequence of professional practice units foster broader capabilities in problem-solving, teamwork, communication, and reflective and ethical practice - all of which help to prepare our students for a range of possible careers in health care or medical research.</p>\n<p>Formal lectures, tutorials, laboratory sessions, practical projects, and online learning - all of which are facilitated by our expert teaching staff comprised of clinicians, researchers and practitioners - as well as private study will help students develop their skills and knowledge. As knowledge acquisition progresses, students will engage in simulation and scenario-based learning - leveraging our state-of-the-art clinical teaching, anatomy and simulation spaces to deliver technology enhanced learning in face-to-face settings (in addition to other eLearning resources). Students will increasingly work independently to develop their research and reflective practice skills.</p>\n<p>These learning methods are supported through the development of a portfolio, interaction with peers, research based work, discussion forums and practical tasks. The course has a work placement within its required PACE (Professional and Community Engagement) unit and this allows students to gain practical experience in a healthcare or medical research related activity. This opportunity further develops their team working and collaborative research and creative problem solving skills.</p>",

The learning and teaching methods that students will encounter are matched to the content of each unit and students can expect to engage in online lectures, tutorials, small and large group learning activities, and skill development training, all of which will require their active participation. Learning and teaching materials are routinely delivered using multimodal resources.</p>\n<p>The academic curriculum is structured sequentially so that students gain knowledge across the range of Speech Pathology practice by the end of Year 1 (i.e., 80cp). In Year 2 there is increased emphasis on case complexity, and systematic development towards Speech Pathology Australia's required levels of knowledge and competence for graduates entering the profession.</p>\n<p>The clinical practicum curriculum is structured to include two types of placements, i.e., those that are one day per week (session placements), and those that are several days per week (block placements). The session placements continue throughout each session, and mean that students will learn concurrently in their coursework and clinical practice units. This structure is designed to foster students' abilities to think critically, gain insight into the clinical relevance of theoretical frameworks and research findings, and develop ability to integrate insights from clinical experiences during classroom-based learning activities with peers. The block placements allow students to learn in clinical settings on a daily basis, offering opportunities to apply and consolidate skills and knowledge in settings that closely approximate everyday speech pathology practice.</p>\n<p>Critical engagement with a variety of perspectives is encouraged during learning activities through the participation of clinical researchers, specialist clinicians, and people with communication disabilities and/or their family members. These practices foster the teamwork and networking required for successful work within the Speech Pathology profession, as well as making learning experiences enjoyable and productive.</p>",

This has been recognised and commended by Speech Pathology Australia, and is reflected in the research conducted by academic staff and graduates of the course.</p>\n<p>On completion of the MSLP, students will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>competent speech pathologists, who are able to assess and treat people with a range of communication and swallowing disabilities.</li>\n<li>critical thinkers, who are able to appraise their own and others' knowledge, beliefs and behaviours, evaluate theories and situations, and take action to solve conceptual and practical problems.</li>\n<li>resourceful, independent learners, who are able to select and participate in ongoing professional development, and successfully engage with novel situations.</li>\n<li>effective communicators, who are responsive to clients' social, cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and provide sensitive and well informed advocacy and advice.</li>\n</ul>",

As such, they can be employed as Speech Pathologists in Australia, and their qualifications are recognised by professional associations in Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland and USA under the terms of a Mutual Recognition Agreement.</p>\n<p>Graduates are most commonly employed in the private sector, by public health service providers, and by not-for-profit organisations. In some Australian states (not including NSW), the school education sector is also a major employer.</p>\n<p>There is a growing trend for graduates to enter the workforce via the private sector, and this trend is expected to increase quickly with the full implementation of National Disability Insurance Scheme.</p>",

Accordingly, learning and teaching methods are designed to meet the individual unit learning outcomes and to foster the acquisition of neuropsychological knowledge and skills, along with developing critical thinking and problem solving abilities. Learning and teaching methods are also tailored to assist in the development of the generic professional and personal attributes required for delivery of neuropsychological interventions, with due regard for ethical practice.</p>\n<p>The learning and teaching methods assist in students' engagement in ethical practices through a combination of lectures and workshop. The methods are student-centred and include online and face-to-face lectures, and practical skill development classes which include simulated learning activities including role-plays, simulated assessments, interviews and rehabilitation options. The methods also include research project development and clinical education. Effective communication verbally and in written form applying digital technologies is a salient feature in the course. The communication is important and needs to be tailored to present information appropriately to clients, doctors and other professionals.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The Master of Applied Linguistics and TESOL degree course aims to train its graduates to become applied linguists who demonstrate a keen awareness of language as it is used in a variety of social and professional settings. Students are therefore trained to develop and apply skills in the observation, critical analysis and evaluation of language in context. Furthermore, they are expected to be able to engage with research in a range of sub-disciplines of applied linguistics, as well as formulating their own research questions in areas of individual interest. A particular focus of the course concerns the teaching and learning of English and a second or foreign language. The learning and teaching methods used in the delivery of the Master of Applied Linguistics reflect these broad aims, as well as the specific course learning outcomes. The exact learning and teaching methods vary from one unit to another, but the following patterns are typical.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course, students will learn through guided and reflective reading of textbooks, monograph chapters, and scholarly journal articles. This reading will generally be guided by pre-reading tasks/activities, and followed by reflective post-reading tasks/activities. Where students are undertaking a unit internally, such tasks will typically be part of face-to-face lecture-workshop sessions on campus, while external students will access them through an online learning interface. Online activities include reflection questions and self-assessment quizzes. Extensive reading is expected when students prepare assignments, and initial assignments in many of the units of the course help students to develop skills in working with the research literature in the different branches of applied linguistics and TESOL.</p>\n<p>Teacher-fronted classroom learning will form part of most units, but will typically be interspersed with individual, group and class activities that enable students to engage with and apply the material as they encounter it. The on-campus sessions are recorded so that they can be reviewed later by internal students, and also accessed by external students. Where face-to-face sessions do not lend themselves to recording (e.g. when the sessions are largely task or discussion based), alternative modes of material delivery are made available to external students. These include podcasts, recorded mini-lectures, written course notes and self-explanatory presentation slides.</p>\n<p>Collaborative discussion and problem-solving is also a key element of the Master of Applied Linguistics and TESOL course. When a unit is studied internally, many of these discussions take place in lecture-workshop sessions. External students interact through online discussion boards, as well as through e-mail contact with teaching staff. For many internal and external unit offerings, online discussion participation is a formal component of the assessment.</p>\n<p>An optional practicum unit forms part of this program. Here, students are expected to translate their knowledge into pedagogical practice, for which they receive both formative and summative feedback from experienced English language teaching practitioners. Students have the option of completing a unit on evaluating language classroom practice in place of the practicum, depending upon their career plans.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Master of Applied Linguistics and TESOL covers theoretical and methodological issues relevant to practitioners in a variety of professions whose work is concerned with applied language study. It is internationally relevant and focuses on the development of analytic skills and understanding the complex relationship between language use and context, and research in these areas. The degree is designed to allow candidates to study a broad range of topics within the area of Applied Linguistics. It covers theoretical and methodological issues relevant to practitioners in a variety of professions whose work is concerned with applied language study. In particular, the degree has been designed to provide a strong theoretical and practical foundation in the field of teaching English as a second or foreign language. Much of the content of the course is also relevant to teachers of other languages.</p>",

The TESOL element enables graduates with prior experience as language teachers to enhance their career prospects in this important field. Our graduates are also employed in a wide range of positions that require effective communication with colleagues, as well as with clients, patients or students. Many work in professions that help others to communicate more effectively in written or spoken form.</p>",

In many assignments, students are required to show an ability to engage with the existing research literature on the topic at hand.</p>\n<p>Another form of assessment is participation in online discussions (see 'Learning and Teaching Methods' above), as an ability to engage collaboratively and cooperatively with issues and problems relevant to the area of study is a key graduate capability. Quizzes (usually online) are used in some parts of the course to check understanding of key concepts.</p>\n<p>In the practicum unit, students are observed in a teaching role, and their performance in this role is a key element of the assessment.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course, assignments and other forms of assessment are spaced so that students receive formative feedback during each semester which they can use in approaching later assessment tasks.</p>",

We aim to achieve this by presenting the material in innovative ways that clearly demonstrate its relevance to problem solving. In particular, the program aims to produce organisational psychologists who are independent thinkers, and who can readily translate their knowledge and problem-solving abilities to new environments and situations with due regard for ethical practice.</p>\n<p>A fundamental aspect of the pedagogy of the course lies in the way it builds from semester to semester, providing a logical, systematic flow through the course from start to finish and ensuring progressive development towards attainment of the program goals and Australian Psychology Accreditation Standards. The focus of the four semesters is outlined below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Semester 1: Foundation organisational psychological skills</li>\n<li>Semester 2: Psychological Assessment in organisations</li>\n<li>Semester 3: Organisational Psychology applications</li>\n<li>Semester 4: Research-Led Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout the course, we emphasize an inquiry-based learning approach that includes online and face-to-face lectures, tutorials and workshops, practical skill development classes, competency assessments, and supervised research project development and implementation, in addition to integrated, practice-education opportunities.</p>",

While embedded in learning within the Australian health care context, a strong emphasis on the comparison of health care systems and on emerging technologies in medical practice will ensure that our students master the cultural awareness and communication skills required for positive patient-centred care in any setting. Macquarie University graduates will be doctors who capably practice quality medicine in diverse local and global communities, and effectively connect with patients and inter-professional teams across cultures.</p>\n<p><strong>Mission</strong><br />The primary mission of the Medical course is to graduate doctors with the scientific, clinical, social and professional capabilities that will serve as the basis for medical practice across the world. By collaborating with domestic and international partners who share similar value sets, we will provide an outstanding clinical and educational experience locally and globally.</p>\n<p>Our primary mission will be realised through our commitment to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparative and reflective approach to learning. We will use a comparative approach to the varied clinical, cultural and health system experiences of the course's diverse group of students. By encouraging reflection on these experiences, we will foster the achievement of an international perspective and a global capability set for our graduates.</li>\n<li>Patient-centred Care. We will graduate doctors who will make the quality of the care of patients their first concern, ensuring health care systems work well for their patients, and applying their knowledge and skills in a practical, professional and ethical manner. They will be practitioners focusing on quality, safety, efficiency, patient advocacy, and team-based care.</li>\n<li>Innovation. We will develop a course that focuses on the role of health systems in the provision of quality care, and on the emerging technologies that will be required for medical practice into the future.</li>\n<li>Cultural competence. We will prepare doctors who are aware of the impact of their own culture and values on their medical practice, and have knowledge of, respect for and sensitivity towards the cultural needs of diverse populations, including Indigenous people. The development of cultural competence will be embedded in the education process of the course.</li>\n<li>Research, and Science-based Practice. We will prepare graduates with research skills who understand how knowledge is discovered and applied, and who will lead the improvement of health and medical care through scholarship and research-informed practice.</li>\n</ul>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The Doctor of Physiotherapy (DPT) program has been developed and delivered based on the assumption that students learn best when they are deeply engaged, motivated and inspired. The DPT teaching team is strongly committed to student-focussed and research-enhanced learning and teaching. Collectively, we are passionate about learning and teaching and view it as a crucial mechanism to enhance the quality of healthcare and facilitate the translation of research into evidence-based practice. Pedagogically, we use reflective practice and enquiry-based learning to ensure students become lifelong learners able to deliver evidence-based person-centred healthcare across the lifespan, which considers both restorative and preventative aspects of healthcare. A fundamental aspect of the pedagogy of the course is the semester by semester structure. This structure provides a logical, systematic flow through the course from start to finish and ensures progressive development towards attainment of the graduate capabilities and outcomes. The focus of the six semesters is outlined below:<br />Semester A: Fundamental physiotherapy skills<br />Semester B: Managing common conditions<br />Semester C: Developing as a clinician<br />Semester D: Managing more complex conditions<br />Semester E: Extended knowledge of future leaders<br />Semester F: Becoming an independent clinician and researcher.</p>\n<p>The teaching team has a coherent philosophy utilising the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as the conceptual framework to underpin the students' development of clinical reasoning and skill acquisition research is used to shape their mastery of clinical physiotherapy skills. We have also embedded the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Pain education curriculum within the course. We value authentic learning and teaching opportunities and provide clinically focussed tasks and activities to motivate and inspire our students. The team understands the power of assessment in driving learning, so our assessment tasks are highly authentic and innovative, some of which specifically add value for our clinical and research partners. We aim to inspire and motivate our students by establishing a strong student-focused learning and teaching culture.</p>\n<p>The specialised teaching rooms were designed as authentic learning environments (e.g. a rehabilitation gym and a clinic room), which are equipped with state-of-the-art ICT, and physiotherapy equipment to engage and motivate students. These facilities also enable students to be co-producers or directors of their own learning by sourcing the latest research evidence or practice guidelines during classes. Our teaching and assessments use novel approaches, which simulate the real-world clinical setting as closely as possible. Our course also integrates clinical placements in both traditional and contemporary settings, including corporate organisations, public &amp; private healthcare facilities, sporting bodies and within the community.</p>",

As the course progresses, students will research, analyse and critique their discipline within its social and environmental settings. This includes in-depth group work where students learn about teamwork, communication, project design and evaluation. Toward the end of their studies, students are expected to apply analytical thinking to complex problems. These learning methods are supported through interaction with peers, research based work, online and face-to-face discussion forums and practical tasks. A work-based learning experience within a PACE (Professional and Community Engagement) unit, and a capstone unit to integrate learning, are requirements of the degree.</p>",

Learning and teaching methods are aimed at individuals achieving the learning objectives of each unit. The teaching methods are designed to enable students to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>acquire Audiology-specific knowledge</li>\n<li>develop critical thinking, team-based and problem solving skills</li>\n<li>foster self-initiative and independence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The learning and teaching methods assist in students' engagement in ethical practices. The methods are student-centered and include online and face-to-face lectures, practica and tutorials. The methods also include research project development and clinical education. Effective communication verbally and in written form is a salient feature in the course. The communication is important and needs to be tailored to present information appropriately to clients, doctors and other professionals.</p>\n<p>The Master of Clinical Audiology course is delivered in two teaching blocks per session; (i) a theoretical block which is focused on developing knowledge through structured lectures, practica and tutorials; and (ii) a clinical block which provides between 2-4 weeks of clinical education for each student. The course is comprised of 16 units (each 10 credit points), 4 per session of which 3 are theoretical and 1 is clinical in nature. All 16 units have formal lectures that are predominantly taught by clinically qualified and professionally accredited staff as well as visiting professionals and industry partners on a variety of technical, professional and social issues centered on clinical practice.</p>\n<p>The course is a 2 year course, where the first year focuses on the diagnostic and knowledge and skill based outcomes while the second year 2 centres on clinical management of clients, their families, and clinical practice, including understanding the hearing healthcare systems. The structure is designed such that there is a systematic segue that ensures progression and development of competencies throughout the two years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Year 1, Session 1: Basic skills</li>\n<li>Year 1, Session 2: Advanced skills and integration of information</li>\n<li>Year 2, Session 1: Advanced skills and management</li>\n<li>Year 2, Session 2: Advanced skills, management and multidisciplinary approach</li>\n</ul>",

All learning activities are supported by an online presence that facilitates web-based group discussion/blogging, communication between staff and students, as well as easy access to multimedia resources and assessment materials.</p>\n<p>Live and recorded lectures and presentations are complemented by smaller group tutorial and workshop sessions along with independent reading and engagement with learning materials.</p>\n<p>Lecture format may be used to present important concepts in a didactic way while at the same time providing opportunities for students to interact with senior teaching staff in a large-group forum. Most lectures are recorded for student convenience and are structured with additional small-group activities and targeted self-study activities in mind.</p>\n<p>Small group activities consolidate materials presented in more formal settings and encourage further independent and collaborative exploration of concepts and ideas. In small groups you will learn to critically appraise relevant literature, make evidence based arguments, give and receive feedback, communicate using a range of media, work as part of a team, conduct small research projects, analyse data, and behave ethically.</p>\n<p>Acquisition of skills essential to speech and hearing science and linguistics is fundamental to the course. Skill development occurs in a supportive and collaborative environment facilitated through the small group format by providing opportunities for group discussion, problem-based learning, focus on analysis techniques, and skills practice. Skill acquisition requires structured experiences with real-world language problems and data collected from a variety of sources. These include direct observations of language and text-based corpora through to physiological and acoustic data captured by state-of-the-art equipment. Laboratory analyses and experiences reinforce the importance of evidence-driven practice and help consolidate concept development through hands-on exploration of data.</p>\n<p>The course has its foundations in research-based theory and practice and therefore research is integrated into every stage of the course. You will be involved in observing, collecting, analysing language data and presenting your findings using a variety of media. You will also be involved in the research-rich culture of the Linguistics Department through participation opportunities with research projects being conducted by staff and higher degree research students. The course is supported throughout by highly experienced teaching staff who are expert researchers in their own field of endeavour.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Bachelor of Speech and Hearing Sciences provides students with an in-depth introduction to skills and knowledge in speech, hearing and linguistics that can form the basis for future studies in Speech and Language Pathology, Audiology, or to research in a wide range of speech, hearing and language sciences related fields. Students will study in an environment that provides access to one of the best-equipped research and clinical environments in the world for speech, hearing, language and cognitive science. Subjects taken in this degree will provide students with discipline specific knowledge. Students will learn how to analyse the structure of language from a range of perspectives including how we produce, perceive and understand spoken language. They will learn the commonalities and differences between the world's languages from both technical (e.g. phonetics and syntax) and sociocultural perspectives. Some aspects of this degree focus on how language is represented in the brain, the relationship between language and society, how it develops in children learning their first language and in children and adults learning a second or other language. Students may also select subjects that involve learning about speech and language disorders, or hearing and its disorders. Many students will use this degree as a gateway to specific clinical training in Speech and Language Pathology or in Audiology. Some students will use this degree as a pathway to further study in areas such as forensic speech science or speech technology. Other students will be considering careers in speech, hearing or language research, possibly leading to academic or research careers.</p>",

Students interested in expanding and applying their knowledge in hearing, and its disorders by pursuing a clinical career in Audiology can do so by completing our Master of Clinical Audiology. Students who wish to pursue a research career, possibly leading to an academic career, may consider doing a Master of Research, and qualified students may follow this with a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in a very wide range of possible research topics relevant to the interests and expertise of academics in the Department of Linguistics. Some students may wish to undertake further study in Forensic Speech Science or Speech Technology.</p>\n<p>In addition, this degree can lead to employment in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public service (at all levels including local, state and federal), especially in departments involved in dealing with migrant populations, bilingual issues, the disability sector</li>\n<li>Non government organisations dealing with refugees, migrants and bilingual issues, the disability sector</li>\n<li>Organisations involved in research, development, and/or marketing of speech, language and hearing related devices/services for augmentative or alternative communication</li>\n<li>Organisations involved in computer mediated communication, for instance, natural language processing and other areas where linguistic knowledge is deemed essential in an increasingly electronic communicative world.</li>\n</ul>",

      "assessment": "<p>Assessment strategies used in the Bachelor of Speech and Hearing Sciences are structured with both formative and summative feedback in mind. Formative assessment allows you to check your development by identifying strengths and highlighting areas that need additional support. Summative assessment is used to evaluate your performance against a set of clearly defined standards.</p>\n<p>All units in the degree involve summative assessment from which final grades are obtained, but many will also offer extensive formative assessment - that is you will receive feedback that should help you identify areas of strength and weakness thereby giving you the opportunity to improve your performance in subsequent tasks. Formative feedback may take the form of nested assessment tasks, peer reviewed activities, and skill practice which, in combination with a more substantial summative assessment such as a longer assignment or examination, provide a set of results that allow for your final grade to be calculated.</p>\n<p>In each unit of study details will be provided to clearly explain what is assessed, how it will be assessed and the weighting of each task. The standards and criteria associated with each assessment task will be advertised along with the detailed instructions for task completion.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks may involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing essays, critical reviews and research reports of various lengths and complexity</li>\n<li>Posting blogs or participating in other kinds of online activities</li>\n<li>Conducting laboratory language data analysis</li>\n<li>Giving tutorial and seminar presentations (group and/or individual)</li>\n<li>Participating in tutorial/seminar activities and in-class discussions</li>\n<li>Describing language data using established theory-driven techniques</li>\n<li>conducting independent or collaborative research projects using language data to explore interesting theoretical questions</li>\n<li>Participating in exams, class tests and online quizzes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Capstone unit, SPHL3300 Language as Evidence, is the culmination of your study in the Bachelor of Speech and Hearing Sciences degree.</p>\n<p>In the capstone unit, the main assessment task will involve you designing and reporting on a small language research project in an area where your main interests and expertise lie. The task is developmentally scaffolded through a set of formative assessment tasks designed to inform your major project and a class presentation.</p>",

Learning is developmentally structured to steadily encourage independence through activities that build on each other in the progression towards mature and accomplished ability and critical thought.</p>\n<p>Learning activities are extensive and varied and include a range of formal and informal experiences. All learning activities are supported by an online presence that facilitates web-based group discussion/blogging, communication between staff and students, as well as easy access to multimedia resources and assessment materials.</p>\n<p>Live and recorded lectures and presentations are complemented by smaller group activities such as tutorial and workshop sessions along with independent targeted self-study reading and engagement with learning materials. Lecture format may be used to present important concepts in a didactic way while still providing opportunities for students to interact with senior teaching staff in a large-group forum.</p>\n<p>Small group activities consolidate materials presented in more formal settings and encourage further independent and collaborative exploration of concepts and ideas. In small groups you will learn to critically appraise relevant literature, make evidence-based arguments, give and receive feedback, communicate using a range of media, work as part of a team, conduct small research projects, learn the essential skills necessary for language analysis, analyse data, and behave ethically.</p>\n<p>Acquisition of skills essential to linguistic study is fundamental to the course. Skill development occurs in a supportive and collaborative environment facilitated through the small group format by providing opportunities for group discussion, problem-based learning, focus on analysis techniques, and skills practice. Skill acquisition requires structured experiences with real-world language problems and data collected from a variety of sources. These may include direct observations of language and text-based corpora through to physiological and acoustic data captured by state-of-the-art equipment.</p>\n<p>The course is founded upon research-based theory and practice and therefore research is integrated into every stage of learning. You will be involved in observing, collecting, analysing language data and presenting your findings using a variety of media. You will also be involved in the research-rich culture of the Linguistics Department through participation opportunities with research projects being conducted by staff and students. The course is supported throughout by highly experienced teaching staff who are expert researchers in their own field of endeavour.</p>",

Students will learn how to analyse the structure of language from a range of perspectives including how we produce, perceive and understand spoken language. They will learn the commonalities and differences between the world's languages from both technical (e.g. phonetics and syntax) and sociocultural perspectives. Some aspects of this degree focus on how language is represented in the brain, the relationship between language and society, and in children and adults learning a second or other language. Students may also select subjects that involve learning about speech and language disorders, or hearing and its disorders.</p>\n<p>The Bachelor of Linguistics and Language Sciences aims to develop graduates who have a broad understanding of how human language works which has application to further study in teaching English language to adult learners (TESOL), editing and publishing, accessible communication, translation and interpreting, or to research in a wide range of linguistic and language sciences related fields.</p>",

      "graduate_destinations_and_employability": "<p>Linguistics is the systematic study of human language including its structure, use and applications in societies around the world. Linguistics graduates are employed in a wide range of occupations that involve a detailed awareness and understanding of language and its use. They are employed as language and communication specialists within government and non-government organisations, particularly in health and business, and in areas specialising in migrant and refugee support. Linguists are essential in language revitalisation and educational programs; as lexicographers (dictionary makers); and as specialists in accessible communication and subtitling. Many linguistics graduates are employed in speech and language technology, in research and in clinical support roles. Occupations including teaching, journalism, broadcasting, dramatic arts, advertising, marketing and public relations benefit from a keen understanding of the relationship between language and society and the ability to successfully use language in beneficial ways. A Linguistics degree also combines particularly well as a second degree with Anthropology, Cultural Studies, Education, English, Cognitive Science, Computing, Languages, International Relations, Media, Politics, Psychology, Engineering, Science, Commerce, Marketing, Medical Science, Policing and Counter Terrorism. Linguistics students may also go onto further study in Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology, Forensic Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, Speech Technology, Editing and Publishing, Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), Translation and Interpreting, Applied Linguistics, and Linguistic Research.</p>",

The standards and criteria associated with each assessment task will be advertised along with the detailed instructions for task completion.</p>\n<p>Depending on choices the student makes from within various option sets, assessment tasks may involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing essays, critical reviews and research reports of various lengths and complexity</li>\n<li>Critical evaluation of theoretical concepts and/or language data collected by others</li>\n<li>Reporting on and critical evaluation of language data you have collected yourself</li>\n<li>Posting blogs or participating in other kinds of online activities</li>\n<li>Tutorial participation</li>\n<li>Tutorial and seminar presentations (group and/or individual)</li>\n<li>Describing language data using established theory-driven techniques</li>\n<li>Conducting independent or collaborative research projects using language data to explore interesting theoretical questions</li>\n<li>Participating in exams, class tests and online quizzes</li>\n</ul>",

Assessments require you to demonstrate practical application of knowledge and skills to interpreting practice.

Written assignments encourage the further development of written communication skills and the ability to engage with the readings on theory and evidence-based practice. In addition, written case studies will provide the opportunity to demonstrate critical analysis of practice and your ability to engage with the research literature.</p>\n<p>Self-reflection and analysis using ELAN annotation software is used for the evaluation of your own (and others') interpreted performances at micro and macro levels.</p>",

Clear standards and criteria for these assessments, for what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide. Some of the practical assessments may be done in part or wholly by other students as peer assessment, and you will also be guided towards improved self-assessment as this is an essential professional skill for translators and interpreters.</p>\n<p>The practical component of the coursework constitutes approximately half of the full course, and this weight is also reflected in the assessment in the program. In the first instance, self- and peer-assessment will form an important part of the practical tutorials. The tasks you will be required to complete in these tutorials will also be assessed formatively during the tutorials by lecturers and or tutors, as well as summatively in longer assignments, tests and examinations. In isolated practical units, the summative assessment will also comply with NAATI requirements for accreditation (application for NAATI accreditation remains an individual choice for students).</p>\n<p>The theoretical and analytical component of the coursework will be assessed formatively in shorter written assessments in the theoretical units but also as analytical assessments in the practical units. This component will also form a substantial part of the summative assessment in the program.</p>\n<p>Students will also be assessed formatively in terms of professional practice through the compilation of a portfolio of practical assignments.</p>",

To that end, you will be guided progressively to carry out various practical, research and theoretical activities both independently and collaboratively. All these activities are conducted on a learner-centred approach, and they include lectures, tutorials, discussion classes, seminars, and intensive internet-based conference interpreting booth practice. You are encouraged, through independent, peer review and group activities, to identify, analyse and solve major skill development problems you have experienced in your practice by drawing on the feedback, suggestions and recommendations provided by your instructors on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>Since interpreting practice is underpinned by a sound knowledge of the theories and research that have informed current views of practice, you will be exposed to a variety of specially designed teaching and learning tasks. These tasks will include research activities ranging from reading, information gathering, data analysis, self-reflection in and on your own conference interpreting practice, and report writing. You will be encouraged to apply linguistic and extra-linguistic skills and knowledge to investigate, analyse, interpret and synthesize complex information, practical problems and theoretical concepts in relation to conference interpreting.</p>\n<p>In addition to class or/and booth-based practice, you are required to regularly reflect on your own performance and keep a reflective journal and a portfolio containing information as to what, how and why you have prepared for your learning.</p>\n<p>This course is a student-centred learning program, structured to promote the life-long learning philosophy. So, great importance is attached to fostering your abilities through larger research projects to initiate, plan, implement, evaluate and improve your conference interpreting-related skills, strategies and knowledge. In these projects, you will learn how to apply theoretical concepts and knowledge of conference interpreting for the benefit of all stakeholders in the industry.</p>",

These will include lectures, discussion classes, tutorials, seminars, workshops as well as a practicum, online activities, all based on a student-centered approach where you will learn to work collaboratively with peers, but also independently.</p>\n<p>Since the course is a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical skills, you will be exposed to a variety of teaching and learning interventions and tasks. These tasks will include various reading activities, information gathering activities, practical exercises, independent research tasks, and self-reflective activities, as well as a practicum where you will obtain experience in a real-world context. You will be encouraged and guided to apply the theoretical knowledge you will acquire in certain parts of the course, in the practical component of the course.</p>\n<p>There is a strong technological component in the course, through which you will be trained to engage with and apply various computer tools in both translation and interpreting. Technology is playing an increasingly central role in the work of language professionals, and you will be prepared to engage with various types of technology in executing your practical tasks. Through this emphasis on technology, you will also be guided to acquire skills that will allow you to adapt to a fast-changing reality.</p>\n<p>In addition to the skills and knowledge you will acquire, you will also be guided to develop the ability to find creative solutions to complex linguistic problems through practical and research-oriented activities. Through these activities you will learn to engage with linguistic choices in translation and interpreting, conduct yourself in interpersonal relations with various agents in the translation and interpreting communication context in a professional and ethical manner.<br />The way the course is delivered allows for your independent development of investigative, analytical, and synthesizing linguistic skills and knowledge in larger research projects where you will be required to deal with complex information, problems, concepts and theories in the practice of translation and interpreting. In these projects, you will be taught to communicate theoretical concepts relevant to your field for the benefit of peers, clients and the general public.</p>",

      "assessment": "<p>The assessment in this course takes a variety of formative and summative forms that can be divided, broadly speaking, into practical assessments, theoretical and analytical assessments and research projects. Clear standards and criteria for these assessments, for what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide. Some of the practical assessments may be done in part or wholly by other students as peer assessment, and you will also be guided towards improved self-assessment as this is an essential professional skill for translators and interpreters.</p>\n<p>The practical component of the coursework constitutes approximately half of the full course, and this weight is also reflected in the assessment in the course. In the first instance, self- and peer-assessment will form an important part of the practical tutorials. The tasks you will be required to complete in these tutorials will also be assessed formatively during the tutorials by lecturers and or tutors, as well as summatively in longer assignments, tests and examinations. In isolated practical units, the summative assessment will also comply with NAATI requirements for accreditation (application for NAATI accreditation remains an individual choice for students).</p>\n<p>The theoretical and analytical component of the coursework will be assessed formatively in shorter written assessments in the theoretical units but also as analytical assessments in the practical units. This component will also form a substantial part of the summative assessment in the course.</p>\n<p>Finally, the research component of the coursework will be assessed mainly summatively in substantial independent research projects in one of the theory units as well as in one of the practical units in the final session.</p>\n<p>During the final session of the course, there will be major summative assessments in terms of research methodology and independent research. In the case of research methodology, students will complete a smaller number of formative assessments, before producing a research proposal as summative assessment. In the case of independent research, students will be required to produce longer research reports in two specific units that will constitute fifty per cent of the assessments for those units. In the same semester, students will also be assessed formatively in terms of professional practice through the compilation of a portfolio of practical assignments.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>In this course, you will be guided and encouraged to acquire the theoretical knowledge and understanding as well as practical skills and methods required to become a professional translator or interpreter, and the research skills to develop advanced knowledge and understanding. Progressively, you will also be guided to achieve this collaboratively, as well as independently in various practical, theoretical, and research activities. These will include lectures, discussion classes, tutorials, seminars, workshops as well as a practicum, online activities, all based on a student-centered approach where you will learn to work collaboratively with peers, but also independently. This will also include a substantial independent research project</p>\n<p>Since the course is a combination of theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and research skills, you will be exposed to a variety of teaching and learning interventions and tasks. These tasks will include various reading activities, information gathering activities, practical exercises, independent research tasks, and self-reflective activities, as well as a practicum where you will obtain experience in a real-world context. You will be encouraged and guided to apply the theoretical knowledge acquired in certain parts of the program, in the practical component of the program. And you will be guided in developing and undertaking a substantial independent research project to contribute to developing an advanced understanding of specific areas of practice and/or the field more broadly.</p>\n<p>There is a strong technological component in the course, through which you will be trained to engage with and apply various computer tools in both translation and interpreting. Technology is playing an increasingly central role in the work of language professionals, and you will be prepared to engage with various types of technology in executing your practical tasks. Through this emphasis on technology, you will also be guided to acquire skills that will allow you to adapt to a fast-changing reality.</p>\n<p>In addition to the skills and knowledge you will acquire, you will also be guided to develop the ability to find creative solutions to complex linguistic problems through practical and research-oriented activities. Through these activities you will learn to engage with linguistic choices in translation and interpreting, conduct yourself in interpersonal relations with various agents in the translation and interpreting communication context in a professional and ethical manner, including in the practice of conducting research.</p>\n<p>The way the course is delivered allows for your independent development of investigative, analytical, and synthesizing linguistic skills and knowledge in a substantial research project where you will be required to deal with complex information, problems, concepts and theories in the practice of translation and interpreting. In these projects, you will be taught to communicate theoretical concepts relevant to your field for the benefit of peers, clients, the general public, and the research community.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Masters of Translation and Interpreting Studies (Advanced) is designed to meet the needs of proficient bilinguals who aim to work as professional translators and interpreters. It is set apart from the Master of Translation and Interpreting Studies (MTIS) in that it allows graduates to achieve greater depth in either Translation or Interpreting or in both disciplines. Furthermore, the award has a stronger research component with a full independent research project. Students will study the skills and knowledge required to perform translating and interpreting in a range of institutional settings common to community and commercial translating and interpreting practice in Australia and overseas with a greater degree of specialisation than in the MTIS. The course focuses on the acquisition and application of theoretical knowledge relevant to translating and interpreting practice required in the profession. Students are also required to design and implement an extensive research project and execute practicum projects with our industry partners in a variety of settings.</p>",

Some of the practical assessments may be done in part or wholly by other students as peer assessment, and you will also be guided towards improved self-assessment as this is an essential professional skill for translators and interpreters.</p>\n<p>The practical component of the coursework constitutes approximately half of the full course, and this weight is also reflected in the assessment in the course. In the first instance, self- and peer-assessment will form an important part of the practical tutorials. The tasks you will be required to complete in these tutorials will also be assessed formatively during the tutorials by lecturers and or tutors, as well as summatively in longer assignments, tests and examinations. In isolated practical units, the summative assessment will also comply with NAATI requirements for accreditation (application for NAATI accreditation remains an individual choice for students).</p>\n<p>The theoretical and analytical component of the coursework will be assessed formatively in shorter written assessments in the theoretical units but also as analytical assessments in the practical units. This component will also form a substantial part of the summative assessment in the course.</p>\n<p>Students will also be assessed formatively in terms of professional practice through the compilation of a portfolio of practical assignments.</p>\n<p>During the final session of thecourse, there will be major summative assessments in terms of research methodology and independent research. In the case of research methodology, students will complete a smaller number of formative assessments, before producing a research proposal as summative assessment. In the case of independent research, students will be required to produce a substantial research report in the final semester.</p>",

Over the three years of the program students will be exposed to all the major areas of psychological study, from the most fundamental brain research through to social issues such as the causes of intergroup conflict. <br />The learning and teaching methods employed throughout the program also reflect this breadth, from online simulation studies and practical work through to sophisticated, reflective field-work, as represented in the 3rd-year Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) unit. The overarching pedagogical approach throughout the program is student-centred learning, with an emphasis, not simply on the acquisition of discipline knowledge, but also on the development of higher-order critical thinking and problem-solving approaches to a range of psychological processes and issues. <br />All lectures are delivered online as the recorded versions of the on-campus delivery. There is a focus in every unit on small-group online learning through tutorial exercises and online discussions. Software to demonstrate laboratory studies and simulation is adapted to meet the needs of online learning. <br />Students are expected to engage with iLearn discussions of lecture and tutorial material, and to test the development of their own understanding via online tests and quizzes. First-year psychology students are also required to participate in web-based Departmental research projects in order to learn how research is conducted and to encourage interaction with more senior scholars in the field.</p>",

This degree is concerned with providing students with a scientific understanding in the psychological processes that underlie behaviour including perception, cognition, learning, motivation, neuroscience, psychopathology, personality, emotion, developmental psychology, health psychology, counselling and social relationships, as well as training in the analysis of data and research methodologies. This course allows students to complete an accredited Psychology degree across three years. Students in this course also have the option to transfer to the Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) course to complete an additional fourth year of honours in Psychology, conditional on meeting the entry requirements. A key feature of the Bachelor of Psychology degree is the capstone unit, which aims to provide students with skills to facilitate their transfer into the workplace, and the opportunity to gain limited but relevant experience working in the field.</p>\n<p>Bachelor of Psychology (OUA) students will be qualified with the award of Bachelor of Psychology.</p>",
