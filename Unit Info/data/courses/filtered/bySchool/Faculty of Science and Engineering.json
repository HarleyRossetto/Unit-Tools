      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The Bachelor of Biodiversity and Conservation aims to develop knowledgeable graduates with the skills to research, evaluate and communicate issues in Biodiversity and Conservation. Our units are therefore strongly student-centred, and focus on developing students' abilities and skills, not just instilling knowledge.</p>\n<p>Most units combine theoretical and practical components. Theoretical components are taught using a combination of lectures, tutorials, workshops and online activities. Practical components involve laboratory-based sessions, field trips to locations on and around campus, in the Sydney Basin, and further afield, as well as role-play scenarios and problem-solving in tutorial sessions. A feature of many units is working in small or large groups, where students can develop the capacity to work with others in a team to achieve a goal. In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>The Biodiversity &amp; Conservation degree is offered in external as well as internal mode. This means that for many units, instead of attending weekly practicals, students can opt to cover these in blocks over several weekends. Furthermore, many of the theoretical aspects can be completed on-line in lieu of lecture attendance. Note that the external offering is designed to maximize flexibility, but does not eliminate the face-to-face component.</p>\n<p>The structure of the Bachelor of Biodiversity and Conservation allows students the opportunity to include a Participation and Community Engagement [PACE] unit where they can apply their skills in the real world in projects with partners outside the University.</p>",

Graduates are able to contribute their knowledge, research skills and real-world experience to a broad range of career paths. Graduates are equipped to gather and analyse data, critically analyse information and report their findings in a professional manner.</p>\n<p>Required units in this degree link background concepts and knowledge with practical experience acquired in the classroom, the laboratory or in the field. Most units use a combination of lectures, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork and online activities. Practical components involve laboratory-based sessions, deriving, analyzing and modeling data, and problem-solving in tutorial sessions. Key units also develop student's skills in presenting information in written and oral formats appropriate to the field. A feature of many units is working in groups, where students can develop the capacity to work with others in a team to achieve a goal. Many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible. Several units are offered in external as well as internal mode.</p>\n<p>A key final year unit within the Bachelor of Environment is designated a Professional and Community Engagement [PACE] unit where students can apply their skills in the real world in projects with partners outside the University.</p>",

This is in recognition that no environmental issue exists outside of a social-political framework or can be evaluated without a firm understanding of the scientific evidence. The course structure allows students to undertake a double major if they wish.</p>\n<p>Students must complete several core units in environmental science and management, particularly in their first and second years of study. Students will also complete a PACE/Capstone unit in their final year and develop strong professional skills to prepare them for a career in the environmental sector.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>During this program, you will be exposed to a number of different teaching methods which aim to facilitate your learning. These methods are not identical for each subject (called units), but essentially consist of varying combinations of lectures, practical classes and tutorials, plus set activities which you need to complete in addition to the face to face teaching sessions. <br />The goal of the Bachelor of Chiropractic Science is to ensure that you complete the degree having attained a set of defined competencies (known at Macquarie University as 'Graduate Capabilities'). In order to develop these, every unit you study will utilise a specific combination of teaching methods which are most appropriate for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Lectures in this degree largely aim to provide a framework upon which you can build further knowledge and skills. Tutorials usually provide the opportunity to enhance your understanding of specific topics, as well as allowing you to communicate with your peers, share opinions, and develop more complex ways of thinking. Practicals have many functions, depending on the subject area. Essentially, they will require that you apply your knowledge in a practical setting, and complement your 'thinking' with 'doing'.</p>\n<p>Anatomical sciences are studied in the 3 years of the program, incorporating lectures, tutorials and practical sessions. The practical sessions use a variety of resources, including anatomical models, skeletons, X-rays and cadavers. Learning human anatomy by seeing it in three dimensions is highly effective. Having the opportunity to 'feel' anatomical structures on living subjects is another invaluable method used in the teaching of these units.</p>\n<p>Chiropractic Science units include lectures and practical classes. Much importance is placed on the latter, as it is here where you will develop your psychomotor skills, preparing you for higher level clinical training in the Master of Chiropractic degree. We also will provide you with specific times during each session during which you can practice your skills in a safe and supervised environment.</p>\n<p>In some subjects, you will have the opportunity to become involved in 'peer assisted learning' programs, in which students who have recently completed a unit help current students with any problems that they may have in understanding the subject material.</p>\n<p>What you do 'outside' the formal classes, such as completing selected readings, completing specific exercises, and researching for assignments, is just as important. It is here that you develop your ability to acquire information from reliable sources, develop organisational and critical thinking skills, allow for self-reflection, and become a responsible learner, an essential requirement for life as a future health professional.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>Chiropractors have the privilege of being able to positively impact people's lives through the provision of natural and non-invasive healthcare methods. They have a deep understanding of the body's structures and how each interacts to affect our health. Using spinal adjustments, manipulation and other physical means to improve neuromusculoskeletal function, chiropractors can help us live healthy and active lives.</p>\n<p>This course - the longest-running in Australia - will prepare students for a rewarding career in one of the largest primary health professions. When combined with the Master of Chiropractic, graduates will be equipped to work in private practice, chiropractic sports medicine, allied health areas, health insurance assessment, medico-legal advising, work health and safety, rehabilitation and research.</p>",

      "graduate_destinations_and_employability": "<p>The need for musculoskeletal care in Australia is well established. This need is currently growing do to the ageing population.</p>\n<p>Most graduates of this degree continue their studies and combine it with the Master of Chiropractic in order to complete the requirements for professional chiropractic registration with the Chiropractic Board of Australia (CBA) under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law. This requires completion of the 2 year FTE Master of Chiropractic. Registered chiropractors work in private practice, chiropractic sports medicine, allied health areas, health insurance assessment, medico-legal advising, work health and safety, rehabilitation and research.</p>\n<p>However, as the Bachelor of Chiropractic Science provides students with a comprehensive foundation in the medical sciences, graduates who do not wish to practice as a chiropractor have a number of options which they can take. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applying for postgraduate medicine or physiotherapy</li>\n<li>Enrolling in the Master of Research</li>\n<li>Working as a chiropractic assistant</li>\n<li>Employment in a diverse range of health related settings</li>\n</ul>",

      "assessment": "<p>Assessment in the Bachelor of Chiropractic Science program has a number of purposes. For you, the student, it is fundamentally about helping you with your learning. This includes helping you to learn what is required in each individual subject (unit), but also in the bachelor program as a whole. By successfully completing the various assessment tasks you will have satisfied the requirements of the course.</p>\n<p>When you complete the degree, you will have attained a wide variety of skills. The reason we can say this with confidence, is because of the assessment process. There are two major processes at work here, known as formative assessment and summative assessment. Both are important. Formative assessment aims to improve your learning, determining where you are having problems, and generally how to fix them. Examples of this type of assessment used in the program include quizzes, homework activities, assignments etc. The assessments in the course serve two functions; A) they facilitate your learning and B) after the successful completion assessments represent evidence that you have learnt the course content.</p>\n<p>Summative assessment allows the teaching staff - and ultimately you - to determine if you have achieved the learning outcomes for each unit. It assesses whether learning has taken place. Final examinations' written and practical - are one type of summative assessment that we use. <br />The chiropractic program utilises a wide variety of assessment methodologies. Apart from the 'usual' types such as written assignments, class tests, laboratory reports and final examinations, there is also special attention given to tasks which assess your chiropractic technique. These tasks are distributed throughout each session, with different weighting assigned to them depending on whether they are used for formative or summative purposes. In anatomy, you will be given 'spot tests', which require you to identify structures on bones, models and cadavers.</p>\n<p>A part of the assessment process which is fundamental to your learning is feedback. This is where you are given information about your performance in your assessment tasks, and highlights topic areas on which you need to improve. It aims to help you achieve the competencies required in your studies. Feedback may be formal or informal, written or oral, individual or group based. <br />As you progress through the program, assessment tasks require you to demonstrate progressive levels of competency. They are devised so we can determine how well you can apply your knowledge, analyse clinical scenarios, and demonstrate the acquisition of psycho-motor skills which can be used in the appropriate clinical context in future years.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>Your focus in this program will be acquiring the skills, knowledge and understanding that will enable you to produce both videogames software and apply your skills in the wider software industry. Central to this will be practical exercises where you will be expected to apply your understanding and hone your skills to produce both designs and actual software. This will be split between games specific projects and learning in broader areas of software development. Practicals will typically have 20-25 students and in these small groups you will be able to discuss your work unit material with your practical supervisor.</p>\n<p>Supporting the practical sessions will be lectures and tutorials. Lectures will assist you in learning the theoretical components of the program. Tutorials (also around 20 to 25 students) will give you an opportunity to both discuss material with, and learn from, fellow students and also develop your understanding through short, focussed, pieces of work. Each unit in the program has a website, which provides access to unit materials and forums for discussion with staff and other students.</p>\n<p>In a number of units, including the final project, you will work in groups, allowing you to develop the ability to work together in a team to achieve a goal. Working in teams is how most games software is developed and a necessary skill for working in the industry. In the final project you will develop your own game. This game and other, smaller, projects (both full games and game components) that you develop during the program can be used to create a portfolio of your work.</p>\n<p>The Bachelor of Games Design and Development includes a Participation and Community Engagement (PACE) unit where students can apply their skills in the real world in projects with partners outside the University.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Bachelor of Games Design and Development program aims to provide graduates with the necessary skills to be a successful videogame designer and developer. Recognising that the videogames industry in Australia is small and jobs are hard to come by, we also intend to give graduates a wider variety of career options in software development and user experience design.</p>\n<p>The BGDD program comprises three streams, addressing three different skill areas important for the field: <br />1. Software development. Videogames are complex pieces of software and their development requires all the skills of another other software development project, including programming, testing, and project management. <br />2. User experience (UX) design. Designing a videogame requires a solid understanding of how players interact with game systems and the experiences that result. This requires skills in UX design and analysis, and user-testing. <br />3. Critical theory. Games are a major media form of the 21st century, and an informed designer needs to understand the social context within which their games exist, including important ethical considerations around audience, representation and the psychological effects of gaming. This stream also emphasises literacy, communication skills and the ability to present a reasoned argument based on academic sources.</p>",

      "graduate_destinations_and_employability": "<p>Graduates will be qualified to work in both the games industry and the wider software industry. They will be well-prepared in the areas of software development, games design and how those two interact. The program allows students to build-up a portfolio of their work as they study, and this will consist of both individual and team-based products. The final year project will allow students to work on a significant project in a team-based environment.</p>",

All assessment tasks analyse and interpret problems as well as testing discipline-specific knowledge. Most assessment work is prepared individually, although group work is used in some units. The final project is a carried out as group. All assessment is based on standards which are provided to students, so that students are aware of what is required for each assessment item</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The diploma program provides students with high level theoretical knowledge and practical laboratory experience in biotechnology. The core content is centered mainly around biochemistry and molecular biology. Practical laboratory sessions constitute a major part of the learning experience. Students will learn how to conduct experiments in a real laboratory environment, and be able to employ the theoretical knowledge they have developed. Most units use a tutorial or workshop format to help reinforce concepts that have already been delivered, and allow for greater student engagement in problem-based learning.</p>\n<p>The majority of information is delivered by face-to-face lectures. However, there is some flexibility within this because most lectures are recorded and are hence accessible online after they have been initially delivered. This is especially useful for part-time students who may be juggling work and study schedules. Considerable effort is made to keep teaching practices interesting and engaging for students. Much of the science involved is a fairly rapidly developing field, so lectures and tutorials need to be reformulated each year to take into account recent developments. In addition to this, a wide variety of teaching practices are used. As examples, students in core units in this program are asked to build models of protein structures, prepare protein extracts from interesting plant samples they have collected themselves and participate in debates based on relevant issues.</p>\n<p>Grad Diploma students will learn to communicate concepts in biotechnology and related sciences in various forms, such as oral presentations, essays, practical reports, and more. The majority of these are individual tasks, while some are done in small groups. An ethics based unit is offered recommended as there are numerous ethical issues intertwined with developments in modern biotechnology. Lastly, students are required to become familiar with modern scientific literature, including reading, summarising and presenting scientific papers, and preparing written work in formats used in scientific publications.</p>",

The majority of assessments are based on the submission of individual coursework in the form of essays, assignments, and practical reports. All units have formal examinations which form a significant part of the assessment of student achievement, and which is where a student's ability to apply knowledge is assessed. Assessment types are diverse across units and may include written (scientific reports, essays, project proposals, case studies, critiques of papers from the current scientific literature) or oral (seminars, debates, discussions) or other forms of multimedia (quizzes, poster presentation, digital media presentations, blogs, wikis). Several units incorporate continuing assessment tasks as a small part of the overall assessment; these typically take the form of submission of written questions after each week's lecture, which are then discussed at the start of the following week's lecture. This provides excellent reinforcement for learning of difficult concepts.</p>\n<p>Clear standards and criteria for all coursework, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide. The program incorporates both formative and summative feedback.Formative feedback is received while working on a task; summative feedback is received once a task has been completed and submitted for assessment. Both forms of feedback are extremely important and provide students with information and guidance on their development and progress. Feedback is mostly provided in written form and occasionally in discussion with peers, tutors and academic advisors. In laboratory practical environments, formative feedback is an essential part of the learning experience, and students 'learn from doing' exactly how to conduct experiments which produce meaningful results.</p>",

Some of these learning and teaching methods will be ones that you have seen before in your undergraduate studies, whilst others may be new to you. The variety of teaching methods are intended to meet the various learning styles students have, and in this way enable you to master the requirements of this discipline. The acquisition of knowledge and skills is discipline specific and is determined by the independent accrediting body &ndash; The Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia (CCEA). The Chiropractic Board of Australia (CBA), a division of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) requires that all Chiropractors must be suitably trained, qualified, and maintain defined standards in order to be registered as healthcare providers. <br />Broadly speaking, you will learn how to assess and manage patients. The content in the postgraduate course builds upon the framework that you developed in your undergraduate studies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures, tutorials and practical sessions are used to help students gain the clinical knowledge and high-level technical-skills necessary for a chiropractic practitioner. These are further enhanced through readings and online presentations.</li>\n<li>There is an emphasis on case-based scenarios which prepare students for real life clinical encounters.</li>\n<li>Equal importance is given to the theoretical and practical components in the course so that you may become proficient at operating in a clinical environment.</li>\n<li>A large component of your final year, and a culmination of much of what you have learnt in the program, is the clinical internship. You will serve as a chiropractic intern at one of the three Macquarie University Chiropractic Clinics. The structure of this internship is designed to hone your clinical capacity in a safe and fully supervised clinical environment. You will be given the opportunity to interact with, diagnose and formulate management plans for the patients that you see in the clinics.</li>\n<li>Clinical placements are also arranged so that you will be exposed to a variety of patient profiles and healthcare settings. You are encouraged to co-manage patients with other healthcare professionals which will foster your interpersonal and professional communication skills.</li>\n<li>In order to develop an evidence-based approach to the profession there is an emphasis on research methodology and research development, culminating in a final year research project. Exposure to the appraisal of research papers throughout this program develops the skills necessary for you to comprehend and appraise clinical research and incorporate this into your clinical practice. This also equips you with the skills required to become a life-long learner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prospective students with a disability which could interfere with their participation in the program are advised to contact the department.</p>",

To be registered, and in order to practice as a chiropractor in Australia, students must attain a high level of clinical knowledge and technical skill. Assessment in this program thus serves to ensure both theoretical and practical competency has been achieved.</p>\n<p>The chiropractic program utilizes a wide variety of assessment methodologies that serve to achieve the clinical competencies set by the accreditation body - The Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia (CCEA). <br />- Classical assessments that are used include written assignments, class tests, and final examinations.</p>\n<p>However, particular attention is given to tasks which assess the diagnostic and clinical capabilities that you will have developed over the course of the program. <br />- These clinical skills are assessed using Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs)</p>\n<p>Your clinical internship in the final year of the Master of Chiropractic has several competency-based assessments that are designed to evaluate your development as a healthcare practitioner. These assessments also provide evidence that you are accumulating the necessary clinical experience to function safely and effectively in the healthcare workforce. <br />- You will show evidence of your acquisition of these competency-based skills through the development of a clinical competency portfolio.</p>\n<p>There are several opportunities to present cases and research material, which develop necessary skills in communication and presentation that are essential to working in a multidisciplinary healthcare team or environment.</p>\n<p>An adjunct to the assessment process is feedback about your performance in your various assessment tasks. This information can be used to highlight areas that require improvement as well as provide you with the framework by which to calibrate your performance against your peers or against previous personal performances. This feedback may be formal or informal, written or oral, individual or group based and makes up a necessary input for you achieve the relevant competencies required in your post-graduate studies.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "The course provides students with high level theoretical knowledge and practical laboratory experience in various areas of biotechnology. The core content is centred mainly around biochemistry and molecular biology. Practical laboratory sessions constitute a major part of the learning experience across the participating units. Students will learn how to conduct experiments in a laboratory environment, and be able to employ the theoretical knowledge they have developed in the experiments. Most units use a tutorial or workshop format to help reinforce concepts that have already been delivered, and allow for greater student engagement in problem-based learning. The majority of information is delivered by face-to-face lectures. Lectures are recorded and are hence accessible online, after they have been initially delivered, for those students who are not attending the lectures. This is especially useful for part-time students who may be juggling work and study schedules. Considerable effort is made to keep teaching practices interesting and engaging for students. As biotechnology is moving forward fast, especially the lectures need to be reformulated each year to take into account recent developments. In addition to this, a wide variety of teaching practices are used. As examples, students in core units in this course are asked to build models of protein structures, prepare protein extracts from interesting plant samples they have collected themselves, participate in debates based on relevant issues, and prepare short films presenting data from recent scientific papers. Biotechnology students will learn to effectively communicate concepts in biotechnology and related sciences in various forms, such as oral presentations, poster presentations, essays, practical reports, and more. The majority of these are individual tasks, while some are done in small groups. An ethics based unit is included in the course, since there are numerous ethical issues that need to be discussed with developments in modern biotechnology. Lastly, students are required to become familiar with modern scientific literature, including reading, summarising and presenting scientific papers, and preparing written work in formats used in scientific publications.",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "Master of Biotechnology is a two-year postgraduate course into which the students (both domestic and international) come to after having completed a relevant BSc degree or equivalent. Some students have already been in the workforce.  Biotechnology is a fast moving field and the lectures provided will provide an update on the latest advancements in the biotechnology space. The hands-on laboratory work component is considerable featuring the application of technologies generally used in biotechnology. The students will graduate with a good grasp of the the concepts and requirements of modern biotechnology and how these can be applied to address real-world problems.",

The majority of assessments are based on the submission of individual coursework in the form of essays, assignments, and practical reports. Some units have mid-semester examinations and all units have formal examinations which form a significant part of the assessment of student achievement, and which is where a student's ability to apply knowledge is assessed. Assessment types are diverse across units and may include written (scientific reports, essays, project proposals, case studies, critiques of papers from the current scientific literature) or oral (seminars, debates, discussions) or other forms of multimedia (quizzes, poster presentation, digital media presentations, blogs, wikis). Several units incorporate continuing assessment tasks as a small part of the overall assessment; these typically take the form of submission of written questions after each week's lecture. This provides excellent reinforcement for learning of difficult and various concepts. Clear standards and criteria for all coursework, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide and are reiterated during lectures or practical sessions. The program incorporates both formative and summative feedback. Formative feedback is received while working on a task; summative feedback is received once a task has been completed and submitted for assessment. Both forms of feedback are extremely important and provide students with information and guidance on their development and progress. Feedback is mostly provided in written form and occasionally in discussion with peers, tutors and academic advisors. In laboratory practical environments, formative feedback is an essential part of the learning experience, and students 'learn from doing' exactly how to conduct experiments which produce meaningful results.",

Most of the units are comprised of three structured learning activities: lectures, tutorials and guided practical exercises.</p>\n<p>Lectures are where theoretical ideas and experimental and quantitative techniques are introduced and illustrated by a range of examples. They provide opportunities for discussion and active engagement, and will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.</p>\n<p>Tutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.</p>\n<p>Practical work is an indispensable part of the program. You will acquire familiarity with computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in lectures and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. These classes are the first setting where you learn to work collaboratively, and preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.</p>\n<p>In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>Mastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The Graduate Certificate of Conservation Biology aims to develop flexible, knowledgeable graduates with the skills to become capable practitioners in biological conservation. Our course therefore strongly encourages self-directed learning, focussing on developing students' abilities and skills, and not just instilling knowledge.</p>\n<p>Our units combine both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretical elements are taught using a combination of lectures, tutorials, workshops and online activities. Practical components involve laboratory-based sessions and field trips, as well as role-play scenarios and problem-solving in tutorial sessions. The use of case studies in lectures and tutorials is an important component, demonstrating the application of theory and research tools to real-world problems in biological conservation. Teamwork is a common feature of practical exercises, where students can develop the capacity to work with others in a team to achieve a goal. In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>The degree is offered in external as well as internal mode. For external mode, instead of attending weekly classes, students complete practical exercises in blocks over several weekends, or by self-directed exercises from their home location. Furthermore, many of the theoretical aspects can be completed on-line in lieu of lecture attendance. Note that the external offering is designed to maximise flexibility, which is especially important to postgraduate coursework students, but does not eliminate the face-to-face component.</p>\n<p>Engagement with the latest research in conservation biology is an important component of the course. The latest developments in theory and research tools will be covered in lectures and tutorials, and case studies are used to demonstrate application to biological conservation. The development of research skills is built into the core coursework units of the course. Importantly, engagement with the conservation professional community is an essential element of the course. Conservation professionals are frequent guest lecturers.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>This course focuses on the theory, practice and ethics of biodiversity conservation and wildlife management, from the level of wildlife populations to entire ecosystems. It will suit current practitioners wishing to upgrade their knowledge and skills as well as those seeking employment in this sector. The course has flexible options for day attendance, distance education and evening classes, allowing for a significant proportion of the course to be completed off-campus.</p>\n<p>Educational aims:</p>\n<p>Instill an understanding of the application of biological theory to the problem of conserving biodiversity from the level of wildlife populations to entire ecosystems</p>\n<p>Gain a wide range of skills in biodiversity survey, monitoring and assessment, from field techniques to computer modelling</p>\n<p>Gain experience in applying theory and skills to real-world conservation problems within a question-based scientific framework</p>\n<p>Develop a familiarity with the unique biodiversity of Australia and its connections with the southern continents and the rest of the globe.</p>",

Our course therefore strongly encourages self-directed learning, focussing on developing students' abilities and skills, and not just instilling knowledge.</p>\n<p>Our units combine both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretical elements are taught using a combination of lectures, tutorials, workshops and online activities. Practical components involve laboratory-based sessions and field trips, as well as role-play scenarios and problem-solving in tutorial sessions. The use of case studies in lectures and tutorials is an important component, demonstrating the application of theory and research tools to real-world problems in biological conservation. Teamwork is a common feature of practical exercises, where students can develop the capacity to work with others in a team to achieve a goal. In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>The degree is offered in external as well as internal mode. For external mode, instead of attending weekly classes, students complete practical exercises in blocks over several weekends, or by self-directed exercises from their home location. Furthermore, many of the theoretical aspects can be completed on-line in lieu of lecture attendance. Note that the external offering is designed to maximise flexibility, which is especially important to postgraduate coursework students, but does not eliminate the face-to-face component.</p>\n<p>Engagement with the latest research in conservation biology is an important component of the course. The latest developments in theory and research tools will be covered in lectures and tutorials, and case studies are used to demonstrate application to biological conservation. The development of research skills is built into the core coursework units of the course. Importantly, engagement with the conservation professional community is an essential element of the course. Conservation professionals are frequent guest lecturers.</p>",

Formative feedback, given while students work on tasks, is given through online discussions and tutorials. Summative feedback is provided once each assessment task is completed.</p>\n<p>In recognition that students learn and communicate in different ways, assessment methods are diverse, with at least three different types of assessment in every unit. Assessment methods include, but are not limited to, quizzes, written assessments (such as scientific reports, grant proposals, case studies, critiques of the scientific and popular literature), oral assessments (such as presentations, debates and discussions), and multi-media presentations (posters, videos, blogs). Most postgraduate units do not have a final exam but rather a final major assignment (written or oral) that assesses higher-level learning and independence rather than a simple demonstration of acquired knowledge.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The Master of Conservation Biology aims to develop flexible, knowledgeable graduates with the skills to become capable practitioners in biological conservation. Our course therefore strongly encourages self-directed learning, focussing on developing students' abilities and skills, and not just instilling knowledge.</p>\n<p>Our units combine both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretical elements are taught using a combination of lectures, tutorials, workshops and online activities. Practical components involve laboratory-based sessions and field trips, as well as role-play scenarios and problem-solving in tutorial sessions. The use of case studies in lectures and tutorials is an important component, demonstrating the application of theory and research tools to real-world problems in biological conservation. Teamwork is a common feature of practical exercises, where students can develop the capacity to work with others in a team to achieve a goal. In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>The degree is offered in external as well as internal mode. For external mode, instead of attending weekly classes, students complete practical exercises in blocks over several weekends, or by self-directed exercises from their home location. Furthermore, many of the theoretical aspects can be completed on-line in lieu of lecture attendance. Note that the external offering is designed to maximise flexibility, which is especially important to postgraduate coursework students, but does not eliminate the face-to-face component.</p>\n<p>Engagement with the latest research in conservation biology is an important component of the course. The latest developments in theory and research tools will be covered in lectures and tutorials, and case studies are used to demonstrate application to biological conservation. The development of research skills is built into the core coursework units of the course. In addition, all students complete an independent research or placement project, supervised by an academic in the Department of Biological Sciences, with the opportunity to include an adjunct supervisor from the conservation professional community. As many of our students are already employed within the professional sector, students can nominate a placement (constituting a discrete project) with their current employer.</p>",

Most of the units are comprised of three structured learning activities: lectures, tutorials and guided practical exercises.</p>\n<p>Lectures are where theoretical ideas and experimental and quantitative techniques are introduced and illustrated by a range of examples. They provide opportunities for discussion and active engagement, and will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.</p>\n<p>Tutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.</p>\n<p>Practical work is an indispensable part of the program. You will acquire familiarity with computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in lectures and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. These classes are the first setting where you learn to work collaboratively, and preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.</p>\n<p>In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>Mastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.</p>",

      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Master of Sustainable Development serves the needs for professional roles in sustainability, in business, industry, the public sector, international organisations, non-government organisations, research think tanks, academia and consultancies.<br />CONTEXT<br />Sustainable development is an internationally embraced imperative oriented to meeting the needs of a growing population for social and economic development while addressing social justice, and ensuring the integrity of the planetary systems to support all life now and for the future. There are Global Goals for Sustainable Development which provide a focus for policy, strategy and action by all countries and organisations. <br />In 2018 Australia made its first report on the national and international actions undertaken for the Sustainable Development Goals in 2018. While Australia provides good case material for learning with good progress on many of the social development goals there are many challenges for the nation such as the rise of inequality and disadvantage, climate change, regional development in Australia, sustainable cities, and the continuing loss of biodiversity.</p>\n<p>DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE MACQUARIE PROGRAM <br />The Master of Sustainable Development has a strong focus on the importance of the quality of the environmental systems and ecological economics to support present and future social development. The core of the degree has a focus on how to effect changes towards sustainable development and to work with stakeholders with diverse perspectives and values and provides students with an option to hone skills to work with business and organisations on bringing about change for sustainability. <br />The degree includes an Australian and international outlook through case studies, and exposes students to field work, practical examples of sustainability in Australia, and interaction with sustainability practitioners and a work practice experience as a consultant. <br />The degree provides options for students to broaden or deepen capabilities in a diverse range of disciplinary options from the environment, economics, law, social science, business and  policy. The degree assists those who wish to integrate more sustainable thinking and innovation into their existing profession or who wish to change professions to be in a more ethically oriented field.</p>",

Most of the units are comprised of three structured learning activities: lectures, tutorials and guided practical exercises.</p>\n<p>Lectures are where theoretical ideas and experimental and quantitative techniques are introduced and illustrated by a range of examples. They provide opportunities for discussion and active engagement, and will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.</p>\n<p>Tutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.</p>\n<p>Practical work is an indispensable part of the program. You will acquire familiarity with computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in lectures and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. These classes are the first setting where you learn to work collaboratively, and preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.</p>\n<p>In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>Mastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the program the Statistics project unit of study allows you to integrate your skills and knowledge, applied to real-life problems.</p>",

It includes specialised areas of study, such as biostatistics, data mining, epidemiological methods, generalised linear models, marketing research, time series and stochastic finance. The program has a strong focus on the application of contemporary statistical methods and the use the latest computational techniques.

The core content of the program focuses on knowledge and skills in relevant fields including Machine learning, Data Mining, Computational Statistics and Text Processing, with a Capstone Project unit on Data Science. In the Practical Sessions students will be able to employ the theoretical knowledge to solve realistic problems. Tutorials/Workshops will help reinforce the theoretical concepts students have been exposed to during lectures. Although majority of information will be delivered by face-to-face lectures, audio/visual recordings of the lectures will be made available to who may miss lectures, or want to re-visit the material. Data Science being a rapidly evolving field, all Learning and Teaching material will be regularly updated. Furthermore, in different units students will come across different teaching practices. For instance, in the Capstone Unit, a small group of students with complimentary skill-sets may be assigned a mentor from an appropriate industry, and the group will complete a project relevant to then industry sponsor to their satisfaction. Master of Data Science students will learn to effectively communicate concepts relevant to their study in various forms including oral presentations, written assignments and project reports. The tasks involved will be a mix of individual as well as group tasks. One of the core units will expose students to various ethical issues that confront data science.</p>",

The advanced level unit are again drawn from both Statistics and Computing with four required units and two selected from an option set. These units cover statistical theory and practical computational methods such as machine learning and big data processing. This combination of skills and knowledge is the main requirement from industry for Data Scientists. The course is completed with a two-unit (20cp) capstone project that can be either an industry placement (internship) or internal research project. This allows students to gain experience working on real Data Science projects and, for appropriate students, direct exposure to industry problems and practices.</p>\n<p>Students who complete certain core and advanced units in both Statistics and Computing can elect to exit with a Graduate Certificate of Data Science rather than complete the full Masters course.</p>",

The course is intended to meet the Australian Computer Society professional standards for ICT and cyber security courses which includes the underlying core body of knowledge in IT and the professional and ethical responsibilities relevant to working in the IT industry.</p>\n<p>The units in the course are taught using a combination of lecture and small-group classes, augmented by learning activities outside of class.</p>\n<p>Lectures introduce concepts and techniques, particularly by example, and provide an opportunity for staff and students to discuss areas of difficulty. In some units, lectures are augmented by prepared videos that cover the basic material and the classes are mostly used for clarifying discussion.</p>\n<p>Small-group classes (e.g., tutorials and practicals) give students an opportunity to work on exercises that reinforce the concepts and techniques from lectures with the guidance of a tutor. Many units feature practical exercises that are completed in a computer laboratory or on a student's own computer.</p>\n<p>Learning materials are selected as appropriate from textbooks, locally-produced lecture notes and exercises, and online materials. In many units students will learn to use software and tools to achieve practical outcomes. We have a preference for open source software that students may obtain and study without cost or prohibitive licensing.</p>\n<p>Computing units require significant work by students outside of class to explore and experiment with the unit material on their own or in a group.</p>",

It provides a comprehensive introduction to the latest technical aspects of cyber security, covering topics such as applied cryptography, offensive security, digital forensics, secure application development, artificial intelligence, data privacy and information security. It features a capstone unit addressing the practical management side of cyber security in a business setting.</p>\n<p>The first distinctive feature of this program is that it deals with all the latest advances in the field. In a fast moving field like cyber security, that is an important advantage.</p>\n<p>Another distinctive feature is that it promotes a multidisciplinary approach to cyber security with a number of units co-taught with other Faculties.</p>\n<p>Finally, it is designed with the strong input from Industry via the Cyber Security Hub. It will deliver graduates with a wide range of capabilities and skills, namely with an operational focus (e.g. SOC analyst), a policy focus (e.g. InfoSec analyst) and a development focus (e.g. DevSecOps). All those roles are in high demand. (COMP1300 Introduction to Cyber Security) or offered by other Faculties (PICT2001, ACCG3060 or BUSL315)</p>\n<p>This course will strengthen the links between Industry and the University as it will effectively become a pipeline of graduates for our Industry partners which will in return provide opportunities for scholarships, internships and work experience.</p>\n<p>A number of students will be given the opportunity to complete an industry internship. This internship will count toward the Degree via completion of one or two dedicated units in their flexible zone.</p>",

The capstone project unit in particular will be a vehicle for developing work readiness and expose students where possible to employers and work practices.</p>\n<p>The Department of Computing has worked with the Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub to develop this program. Seven new units have been created specifically for the purposes of this audience. We aim to ensure that students have a range of experiences through their study, for example the use of different tools and technologies in the different units our goal is to provide students with a wide array of experience to help them understand the range of choices of tools and techniques available to them. Similarly, assessment types are coordinated over the program to ensure that students see a balance of practical and written assessment in the program.</p>\n<p>Careers include Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, Ethical Hacker, SOC Manager, Risk Analyst, Security Administrator, Security Architect, Security Consultant, etc</p>\n<p>Employers range across the board from IT and Telco companies (Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Optus, Telstra) to consultancies (EY, KPMG, PwC, Deloitte), financial sector (banks and insurance companies) and government.

The course is intended to meet the Australian Computer Society professional standards for ICT courses which includes the underlying core body of knowledge in IT and the professional and ethical responsibilities relevant to working in the IT industry.</p>\n<p>The units in the course are taught using a combination of lecture and small-group classes, augmented by learning activities outside of class.</p>\n<p>Lectures introduce concepts and techniques, particularly by example, and provide an opportunity for staff and students to discuss areas of difficulty. In some units, lectures are augmented by prepared videos that cover the basic material and the classes are mostly used for clarifying discussion.</p>\n<p>Small-group classes (e.g., tutorials and practicals) give students an opportunity to work on exercises that reinforce the concepts and techniques from lectures with the guidance of a tutor. Many units feature practical exercises that are completed in a computer laboratory or on a student's own computer.</p>\n<p>Learning materials are selected as appropriate from textbooks, locally-produced lecture notes and exercises, and online materials. In many units students will learn to use software to achieve practical outcomes. We have a preference for open source software that students may obtain and study without cost or prohibitive licensing.</p>\n<p>Computing units require significant work by students outside of class to explore and experiment with the unit material on their own or in a group.</p>",

A foundation of programming, data, networking and cyber security provides a solid base for later study. The majors focus on important current areas of Information Technology.  Any pair of majors can be taken as a double major combination. Electives and flexible unit choice allow the majors to be complemented by more Information Technology study or by units from other disciplines.</p>\n<p>The emphasis in all majors is on concepts, insights and skills that enable graduates to use current technologies and to also evaluate and adapt to new technologies as they emerge. Central to the learning of the conceptual material is extensive practical experience where non-trivial problems are analysed, solutions designed and developed, both individually and in groups.</p>\n<p>A final-year industry-based group project in the PACE/capstone unit brings everything together to solve a real world problem.</p>",

Industries with a particular and growing reliance on IT are finance, health and entertainment. Typical roles include software and app developer, data analyst, database designer, systems administrator, and security expert. In addition to specific roles, many higher-level jobs employ a knowledge of IT across different areas, such as project leader, consultant, and business analyst.</p>\n<p>The units and majors in this course are designed so that students can tailor their study to their interests and to desired job roles. Each major contributes an important set of knowledge and skills that target areas of real need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyber Security: all IT professionals need a grounding of security knowledge and cyber security experts are increasingly vital for modern organisations.</li>\n<li>Data Science: a key area of application of modern IT is to analyse large amounts of data in a sound and principled way.</li>\n<li>Information Systems and Business Analysis: the use of IT in organisations is vital to their success so graduates with an organisational view to augment technical knowledge are important.</li>\n<li>Software Technology: professionals who are able to design, develop, test and maintain software from first principles are needed everywhere.</li>\n<li>Web and Mobile App Development: much modern use of IT is via web and mobile applications that operate across the Internet.</li>\n</ul>",

In some units, lectures are augmented by prepared videos that cover the basic material and the classes are mostly used for clarifying discussion.</p>\n<p>Small-group classes (e.g., tutorials and practicals) give students an opportunity to work on exercises that reinforce the concepts and techniques from lectures with the guidance of a tutor. Many units feature practical exercises that are completed in a computer laboratory or on a student's own computer.</p>\n<p>Learning materials are selected as appropriate from textbooks, locally-produced lecture notes and exercises, and online materials.

The course includes a combination of 6000 and 8000 level units in both Computing and Management to mirror the 'Information Systems and Business Analysis' major in our BIT course: this provides students with the grounding in core topics required for advanced study in the second year. The advanced level units are again drawn from both computing and management with four required units and two selected from an option set. These units provide the student with the opportunity to develop specialist knowledge in key growth areas within the computing, business and management disciplines. The course is completed with a two-unit (20cp) capstone project that can be either an industry placement (internship) or internal research project. This capstone allows students to gain experience working on real information technology management projects and for appropriate students - direct exposure to industry problems and practices.</p>",

Employability is embedded through the course with work-relevant problems used to motivate and drive the learning experience. The capstone project unit in particular will be a vehicle for developing work readiness and expose students where possible to employers and work practices. The advantage of this being a relatively small course is that the assessment can be reviewed across the course and coordinated between different units. We aim to ensure that students have a range of experiences through their study, for example the use of different software systems in the different units. Our goal is to provide students with a wide array of experience to help them understand the range of choices of technology available to them. Similarly, assessment tasks are coordinated over the course to ensure students see a balance of practical and written assessment in the course.</p>",

The course is intended to meet the Australian Computer Society professional standards for ICT and cyber security courses which includes the underlying core body of knowledge in IT and the professional and ethical responsibilities relevant to working in the IT industry.</p>\n<p>The units in the course are taught using a combination of lecture and small-group classes, augmented by learning activities outside of class.</p>\n<p>Lectures introduce concepts and techniques, particularly by example, and provide an opportunity for staff and students to discuss areas of difficulty. In some units, lectures are augmented by prepared videos that cover the basic material and the classes are mostly used for clarifying discussion.</p>\n<p>Small-group classes (e.g., tutorials and practicals) give students an opportunity to work on exercises that reinforce the concepts and techniques from lectures with the guidance of a tutor. Many units feature practical exercises that are completed in a computer laboratory or on a student's own computer.</p>\n<p>Learning materials are selected as appropriate from textbooks, locally-produced lecture notes and exercises, and online materials. In many units students will learn to use software and tools to achieve practical outcomes. We have a preference for open source software that students may obtain and study without cost or prohibitive licensing.</p>\n<p>Computing units require significant work by students outside of class to explore and experiment with the unit material on their own or in a group.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>There is a well-documented skills gap in cyber security and a huge demand from industry for Cyber Security capable graduates at undergraduate and master's level. Macquarie International and our industry partners have been asking for programs like this for some time and are very supportive of the program we have developed. We have frequent requests from industry for access to our best students.</p>\n<p>The course has been designed as an advanced course in the technology aspects of Cyber Security for students with a Bachelor Degree in IT. For students with no background in cybersecurity this course includes a full semester of preparatory units (6000 level). This provides students with the grounding in core topics required for advanced study in the following 3 semesters. The advanced level units are drawn from Computing with 5 new units covering theory and practice in data privacy and information security, artificial intelligence, security operations, identity management, etc. This combination of skills and knowledge is in high-demand from industry. The course is completed with a two-unit (20cp) capstone project that can be either an industry placement (internship) or an internal research project. This allows students to gain experience working on real Cyber Security projects and, for appropriate students, direct exposure to industry problems and practices.</p>",
      "support_for_learning": "",
      "graduate_destinations_and_employability": "<p>Employability is embedded through the program with work-relevant problems used to motivate and drive the learning experience. The capstone project unit in particular will be a vehicle for developing work readiness and expose students where possible to employers and work practices.</p>\n<p>The advantage of this being a relatively small program is that the assessment can be reviewed across the program and coordinated between different units. The Department of Computing has worked with the Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub to develop this program. Five new units have been created specifically for the purposes of this audience. We aim to ensure that students have a range of experiences through their study, for example the use of different tools and technologies in the different units - our goal is to provide students with a wide array of experience to help them understand the range of choices of tools and techniques available to them. Similarly, assessment types are coordinated over the program to ensure that students see a balance of practical and written assessment in the program.</p>\n<p>Careers include Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, Ethical Hacker, SOC Manager, Risk Analyst, Security Administrator, Security Architect, Security Consultant, etc</p>\n<p>Employers range across the board from IT and Telco companies (Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Optus, Telstra) to consultancies (EY, KPMG, PwC, Deloitte), financial sector (banks and insurance companies) and government.</p>",

The course is intended to meet the Australian Computer Society professional standards for ICT courses which includes the underlying core body of knowledge in IT and the professional and ethical responsibilities relevant to working in the IT industry.</p>\n<p>The units in the course are taught using a combination of lecture and small-group classes, augmented by learning activities outside of class.</p>\n<p>Lectures introduce concepts and techniques, particularly by example, and provide an opportunity for staff and students to discuss areas of difficulty. In some units, lectures are augmented by prepared videos that cover the basic material and the classes are mostly used for clarifying discussion.</p>\n<p>Small-group classes (e.g., tutorials and practicals) give students an opportunity to work on exercises that reinforce the concepts and techniques from lectures with the guidance of a tutor. Many units feature practical exercises that are completed in a computer laboratory or on a student's own computer.</p>\n<p>Learning materials are selected as appropriate from textbooks, locally-produced lecture notes and exercises, and online materials. In many units students will learn to use software and tools to achieve practical outcomes. We have a preference for open source software that students may obtain and study without cost or prohibitive licensing.</p>\n<p>Computing units require significant work by students outside of class to explore and experiment with the unit material on their own or in a group.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>In the first year of the Bachelor of Medical Sciences students acquire foundation knowledge and capabilities necessary for focussed study in one of the many majors offered in the program. In the majors, students will build on their core learnings of knowledge, concepts and laboratory skills through the gradual introduction of more difficult concepts and procedures at each level of the Degree.</p>\n<p>Students will learn through a combination of lectures, practical classes and small-group classes that cover weekly themes. Lectures introduce knowledge and concepts, which are further explored through enquiry-based learning in practical classes. Activities in practical classes reflect real world applications that students investigate using research-led activities. Learning encompasses strong medical and health research themes and students will frequently design and perform small experiments, analyse and interpret data and use this information to prepare assessments using modes of communication common in the sciences. Concepts, techniques and problem-based tasks are further explored in lectorials that comprise a mini-lecture followed by student-led collaborative activities that aim to encourage independent learning.</p>\n<p>Learning activities will include acquiring and synthesising information from a range of sources including scientific journal articles and health agency websites; practising skills such as laboratory techniques and a wide-range of communication tasks to achieve competency; and working collaboratively with students on learning activities. Students will also learn how to work in a safe and ethical manner.</p>\n<p>Students will have the opportunity to develop communication skills using appropriate forms to effectively reach a wide-range of people including scientists, patients and the community. Opportunities to further develop communication skills are presented through participation in health events and community outreach activities.</p>\n<p>An important component of this degree are the numerous opportunities to connect with future employment areas. Students will hear from medical and health industry professionals and recent program graduates as soon as they begin university. The early integration of industry professionals will contextualise the learning activities of the program. In the final year of study students undertake a work-based learning activity as part of the University's Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) initiative. The PACE unit will enable opportunities for group-based, industry-focused placements within potential employment areas that may span government organisations, laboratories, allied health, and biotechnology companies.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Bachelor of Medical Science is a broad-ranging degree that prepares you for diverse career pathways. The first year provides the foundation to a wide-range of areas in medical science and prepares you for in-depth study in a chosen area gained through one of the majors of the degree. Each major provides both deep and broad coverage of its area, with majors spanning the anatomy and physiology of the human body, laboratory diagnostics, disease, biosecurity, drug discovery and health communication. The degree is flexible and allows you to study double majors, minors in emerging areas of health and medical science, or a major complemented with your choice of units.</p>\n<p>The course integrates contact with medical and health professionals from first year, allowing you to hear from those currently employed in the field early in your program. Early contact with medical professionals will provide first-hand information on the range of career options available to you, allowing you to tailor your study to ensure you are on track for your chosen career path.</p>\n<p>Critical employability skills will be addressed both in the core units and through embedded learning in the discipline specific majors. You will master laboratory skills that are essential for a medical scientist, and develop the capability to solve problems of a medical and health related nature. You will learn to communicate effectively to a wide range of people using a range of communication tools and gain an understanding of ethics and cultural considerations relative to medical science. Your study will include work-integrated learning activities, and a final year major activity through the University's Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) initiative. This activity is undertaken in conjunction with a partner organisation servicing a key aspect of health.</p>\n<p>The Bachelor of Medical Science is offered jointly between Faculty of Science and Faculty of Medical and Health Science. Teachers in the course are recognised for their excellence in teaching and are at the forefront of research, ensuring you are taught with the most up-to-date and globally relevant knowledge for a career in medical science.</p>\n<p>More information can be found in the information on the individual Majors.</p>",

      "graduate_destinations_and_employability": "<p>Many of the global challenges we currently face, and those emerging, are connected to health and medicine. Health is also identified as a major area of growth in the jobs market. The program is designed to provide students with core skills and facilitate progression to the workforce or further study. We also aim to equip graduates with knowledge and skills to deal with future health problems â€“ which is a core value of the program.</p>\n<p>Students graduating with the Bachelor of Medical Sciences enter the workforce as laboratory or medical scientists, in biotechnology areas as laboratory personnel or managers, sales and marketing roles in medical and pharmaceutical companies, and in Government Health and Biosecurity agencies. The degree also facilitates progression to postgraduate studies in medical and allied health and research. The majors offered within the program allow for a concentration of study that aligns to graduate destinations. Flexibility within the program allows students diversify with a second major or minors that complement the wide variety of graduate employment areas.</p>\n<p>Employability skills begin in the first year where study is integrated with relevant industries. Students will hear from professionals via guest lectures from medical scientists, Government health agency employees. They will also hear from previous program graduates students who have sat a medical admission test and entered medicine as well as graduates employed in various sectors encompassing medical and health sciences. Key skills, laboratory methodologies, and concepts relevant to a career in medical and health sciences are integrated in the assessment strategy, allowing students to develop these capabilities. Communication skills are embedded from the first year of study and the assessment structure is varied and reflective of the different modalities for communication in health and science (e.g. scientific reports, posters, fact sheets and patient interactions). All units are structured to enable students to develop team work and leadership skills. Work Health and Safety, Indigenous themes, and Ethics will be strongly integrated in core units and the capstone and professional behaviour will be emphasised in communications with other students, visitors and staff.</p>",

      "assessment": "<p>A progressive assessment strategy is applied from the very beginning of the program. Students build on their knowledge and capabilities as they progress throughout the different years of study. The assessments comprise both individual and group-based activities, and students are guided by clear standards and criteria (outlining what is assessed and how it is assessed) that are included in each unit guide. The types of assessments used align to course learning outcomes and the roles, activities and task that would be expected of graduate destinations. Students will receive feedback to help guide them while working on tasks (formative feedback) and on completion of tasks (summative feedback) to enable development. Feedback will be in a variety of forms including feedback for individual students and feedback directed to the entire cohort. Provision of feedback maybe in written and/or verbal form.</p>\n<p>The assessments aims to evaluate students understanding and knowledge of concepts, laboratory competencies and communication skills and develop leadership ability. Assessment within the Bachelor of Medical Sciences embeds the diverse communication modalities required in the field (scientific reports, literature reviews, scientific posters, debates, and oral presentations) and enables capabilities associated with knowledge, understanding and synthesis to be assessed. Other forms of assessment relate to laboratory skills and competencies such as equipment use, data analysis and safety, and research and problem solving capabilities including experimental design and data interpretation.</p>",

The course is intended to meet the Engineers Australia Stage 1 Professional Engineering competency standards that include a strong science base of mathematics, physics, computing and related areas, design and project skills, specialised knowledge in a particular area of engineering and professional practice skills. The learning activities are designed to foster these skills in the students. The academics involved with this course are active researchers, and this enables them to integrate cutting-edge research into the units that they teach.</p>\n<p>The majority of the units in this course have practical components including laboratory-based sessions where students can develop practical skills and learn safe laboratory practices. In these sessions, students gain experience in planning, design, testing, measurement, use of software and hardware tools, comparing theory with practice and evaluating investigations. Some units utilise small groups where students work in a team to achieve a goal. Communication skills are developed through oral presentations and teamwork. Engineering practice skills are developed across the course in a variety of activities including teamwork, discussion mode and report/documentation writing activities.</p>\n<p>The theoretical components of units develop the underlying principles, along with analytical and problem-solving skills using a combination of lectures, tutorials and online learning resources. All units have weekly face-to-face activities. Assignments are used for formative and summative purposes. As knowledge in engineering is continually evolving, learning and teaching methods support the capacity for students to become independent life-long learners.</p>\n<p>The course also features a coherent set of professional engineering units that span your entire experience at Macquarie and is a common touchpoint for all students. Through these units, you will have a scaffolded experience that builds your skills before applying them to a complex multi-disciplinary project and finishes with a review of professional engineering practice before you step into the workforce.</p>\n<p>The Engineering course culminates in the final year with students doing a dedicated research thesis project that develops skills and knowledge of research principles and methods. This can be either in an in-house setting with a primary academic supervisor or externally to the university in a company or research organisation setting with a primary industry supervisor supported by an academic supervisor. The project allows students to apply, in an integrated manner, the knowledge and skills they have developed in their studies to a substantial engineering design, analysis or research problem.</p>",

These assessments are designed not just to test discipline-specific knowledge, but all aspects of professional engineering competency including professional practice, project work, engineering design, communication skills, laboratory skills, use of engineering software and design tools and research skills. In addition to formal assessments, students are provided with informal feedback from staff and their peers throughout the semester.<br />Assessment types are diverse and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assignments - tasks designed to develop the understanding of a learning outcome</li>\n<li>Laboratory reports - formal descriptions of laboratory and practical work for a single or multiple session</li>\n<li>Technical documentation - The preparation of requirements, design documentation and project plans develop technical reporting that analyses skills</li>\n<li>Oral presentations - develop communication skills with a variety of diverse professional audiences</li>\n<li>Log books and notebooks - develop the capacity to record results, working designs, consultations and data recording</li>\n<li>Group reports - are used when group projects or group laboratory work is conducted</li>\n<li>Final examinations - assess an individual’s theoretical understanding and application of knowledge</li>\n<li>Quizzes and in-class tests - provided continual assessment and provide feedback to students on learning progress</li>\n<li>Attendance and self-management - assess and develop engagement and professional demeanor in formal tutorial and laboratory sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Research Thesis – this is a substantial dissertation on the final semester engineering research project - the culmination of a student’s study in the Honours course demonstrating advanced understanding in the context of a complex problem that develops new understanding.</p>\n<p><strong>Honours</strong></p>\n<p>Honours Classification is, in part, based on the calculation of a “Honours Weighted Average Mark” (HWAM) for all qualifying units. That is, units studied at Macquarie University which are recognised in the Bachelor of Engineer (Honours) Core Zone, and units completed in the Flexible Zone which are also recognised in the Core Zone of any specialisation of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), for which a standardised numerical grade (SNG) has been recorded.</p>\n<p>For each qualifying unit, the weight applied is given by the credit points for that unit multiplied by the level (2, 3, or 4) of that unit, where the level is 2 for any 2000-level unit, 3 for any 3000-level unit or 4 for units at 4000-level and above. The exception to this includes 1000-level units, where the weight is zero, and Research Thesis units, where a level of 6 is used (weight 1.5 times that of other 4000-level units). Units not recognised in the Core Zone of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) will not be included in the calculation.</p>\n<p>A capped mark of 50 out of 100 will be used for all units where a previous fail has been recorded. Permitted withdrawals (withdrawal without academic penalty) are not included in the calculation of the HWAM.</p>\n<p>Honours is awarded based on performance, as measured by the HWAM as described above and in the final semester Research Thesis units.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honours Class I is awarded to students who achieve a HWAM of 80 or greater and a result in the research thesis of 65 or greater.</li>\n<li>Honours Class II (Division 1) is awarded to students who achieve a HWAM of 72.5 or greater (but less than 80) and a result in the research thesis of 65 or greater.</li>\n<li>Honours Class II (Division 2) is awarded to students who achieve a HWAM of 65 or greater (but less than 72.5) and a result in the research thesis of 65 or greater.</li>\n<li>Honours Class III is awarded to students who achieve a HWAM of 50 or greater (but less than 65).</li>\n</ul>",

The course is intended to meet the Engineers Australia Stage 1 Professional Engineering competency standards that include a strong science base of mathematics, physics, computing and related areas, design and project skills, specialised knowledge in a particular area of engineering and professional practice skills. The learning activities are designed to foster these skills in the students. The academics involved with this course are active researchers, and this enables them to integrate cutting-edge research into the units that they teach.</p>\n<p>The majority of the units in this course have practical components including laboratory-based sessions where students can develop practical skills and learn safe laboratory practices. In these sessions, students gain experience in planning, design, testing, measurement, use of software and hardware tools, comparing theory with practice and evaluating investigations. Some units utilise small groups where students work in a team to achieve a goal. Communication skills are developed through oral presentations and teamwork. Engineering practice skills are developed across the course in a variety of activities including teamwork, discussion mode and report/documentation writing activities.</p>\n<p>The theoretical components of units develop the underlying principles, along with analytical and problem-solving skills using a combination of lectures, tutorials and online learning resources. All units have weekly face-to-face activities. Assignments are used for formative and summative purposes. As knowledge in engineering is continually evolving, learning and teaching methods support the capacity for students to become independent life-long learners.</p>\n<p>The course also features a coherent set of professional engineering units that span your entire experience at Macquarie and is a common touchpoint for all students. Through these units, you will have a scaffolded experience that builds your skills before applying them to a complex multi-disciplinary project and finishes with a review of professional engineering practice before you step into the workforce.</p>\n<p>The Master of Engineering in Electronics Engineering includes a dedicated research thesis project that develops skills and knowledge of research principles and methods. This can be either in an in-house setting with a primary academic supervisor or externally to the university in a company or research organisation setting with a primary industry supervisor supported by an academic supervisor. The project allows students to apply, in an integrated manner, the knowledge and skills they have developed in their studies to a substantial engineering design, analysis or research problem.</p>",

The course is intended to meet the Engineers Australia Stage 1 Professional Engineering competency standards that include a strong science base of mathematics, physics, computing and related areas, design and project skills, specialised knowledge in a particular area of engineering and professional practice skills. The learning activities are designed to foster these skills in the students. The academics involved with this course are active researchers, and this enables them to integrate cutting-edge research into the units that they teach.</p>\n<p>The majority of the units in this course have practical components including laboratory-based sessions where students can develop practical skills and learn safe laboratory practices. In these sessions, students gain experience in planning, design, testing, measurement, use of software and hardware tools, comparing theory with practice and evaluating investigations. Some units utilise small groups where students work in a team to achieve a goal. Communication skills are developed through oral presentations and teamwork. Engineering practice skills are developed across the course in a variety of activities including teamwork, discussion mode and report/documentation writing activities.</p>\n<p>The theoretical components of units develop the underlying principles, along with analytical and problem-solving skills using a combination of lectures, tutorials and online learning resources. All units have weekly face-to-face activities. Assignments are used for formative and summative purposes. As knowledge in engineering is continually evolving, learning and teaching methods support the capacity for students to become independent life-long learners.</p>\n<p>The course also features a coherent set of professional engineering units that span your entire experience at Macquarie and is a common touchpoint for all students. Through these units, you will have a scaffolded experience that builds your skills before applying them to a complex multi-disciplinary project and finishes with a review of professional engineering practice before you step into the workforce.</p>\n<p>The Master of Engineering Management includes a dedicated research thesis project that develops skills and knowledge of research principles and methods. This can be either in an in-house setting with a primary academic supervisor or externally to the university in a company or research organisation setting with a primary industry supervisor supported by an academic supervisor. The project allows students to apply, in an integrated manner, the knowledge and skills they have developed in their studies to a substantial engineering design, analysis or research problem.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>In this course you will build your knowledge and skills in the experimental, technical and theoretical aspects of your chosen discipline and develop understanding of its methodology, relationship with other disciplines and practical applications. Most of the units are comprised of three structured learning activities: lectures, tutorials and guided laboratory/practical exercises.</p>\n<p>Lectures are where theoretical ideas and experimental and quantitative techniques are introduced and illustrated by a range of examples. They provide opportunities for discussion and active engagement, and as your studies progress will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.</p>\n<p>Tutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.</p>\n<p>Laboratory and practical work is an indispensable part of a science education. You will acquire familiarity with experimental and/or computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in lectures and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. These classes are the first setting where you learn to work collaboratively, and preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.</p>\n<p>Where appropriate study includes field trips to locations at and around campus, the Sydney Basin, and further afield, as well as role-play scenarios and problem-solving in tutorial sessions.</p>\n<p>In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>Mastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.</p>\n<p>From the first year you will be engaged in a collaborative work, both in tutorials and laboratories. With your study progression you become exposed to less structured activities, such as individual or group-based research projects, and formal and informal presentations. There are many instances of blended learning activities, including a combination of online and face-to-face modes, or group and/or one-to-one activities are combined.</p>\n<p>A feature of Macquarie University degrees is the inclusion of work-integrated learning in the form of the nationally-recognised PACE (Professional and Community Engagement) units. During your study you will take one of the designated PACE units, which provides opportunity for Work Integrated Learning</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the program the Capstone unit of study allows you to integrate your skills and knowledge, applied to real-life problems.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Bachelor of Science is a broad-ranging degree allowing you to follow a path to suit your intended career in the sciences. Students will undertake in-depth study of a chosen area of science by selecting one of the majors of the degree. Supporting the primary study in the area of the major, students will select a minor from one of the other disciplines included in the degree. This will provide a breadth of education across science will supporting the in-depth education provided by the major.</p>\n<p>Core units in the degree will address the quantitative skills needed by all scientists. Scientists need to be able to understand, analyze and communicate data.</p>\n<p>Critical employability skills will be addressed both in the core units and through embedded learning in the discipline units of the majors .</p>\n<p>The course integrates real world learning activities, culminating in a PACE unit. Each such unit includes a work-integrated learning activity, undertaken in conjunction with a partner organisation.</p>\n<p>By providing both in-depth discipline education as well as the broader skills required by all scientists the degree will provide a world class science education.</p>\n<p>The Bachelor of Science will help you develop skills such as problem solving and critical thinking through practical work and peer-assisted learning. Our science staff are recognised for their excellence in teaching and many are known internationally for their research, ensuring you are taught with the most up-to-date scientific knowledge.<br />More information can be found in the information on the individual majors.</p>",

Assessment tasks are intended both to measure individual progress and provide you with information and guidance on your development.</p>\n<p>Our assessments are designed not only to test students' discipline-specific knowledge and skills but also their ability to integrate and analyse information to solve real-world problems. Assessments are spread throughout semester to enable students to build confidence and gain feedback as they learn. In addition to formal assessments, students are provided with regular informal feedback on their progress. This is done through activities that involve self- and peer-evaluation, as well as through our strong student support system of tutors and academic advisors.</p>\n<p>Assessment types used include (but are not limited to) problem solving, laboratory work and reports, oral presentations, essays, active participation in lectures and/or tutorials, online and in-class quizzes, individual and group projects and multi-media presentations (posters, videos, blogs). Formal examinations are part of the assessment of the majority of units and involve solving of problems appropriate for the scope and level of the unit.</p>\n<p>Standards and criteria for coursework, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide or may be made available via the university learning management system. Assessment is undertaken by academic staff, demonstrators and tutors. In some cases peer assessment will contribute to the grade. In some units, a component of the final grade will be determined by the assessment of work placement supervisors or guest lecturers.</p>\n<p>Where group work is involved, a self-reflection and peer assessment/feedback in the form of contribution to the assessment task may be incorporated into the requirements of the assessment so that your individual contribution can be identified.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>In this course you will build your knowledge and skills in the experimental, technical and theoretical aspects of your chosen discipline and develop understanding of its methodology, relationship with other disciplines and practical applications. Most of the units are comprised of three structured learning activities: online lectures, tutorials and guided laboratory/practical exercises.</p>\n<p>Online lectures are where theoretical ideas and experimental and quantitative techniques are introduced and illustrated by a range of examples. They provide opportunities for active engagement, and as your studies progress, will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.</p>\n<p>Tutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in online lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.</p>\n<p>Laboratory and practical work is an indispensable part of a science education. You will acquire familiarity with experimental and/or computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in online lectures, and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. Preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.</p>\n<p>In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, readings, online activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.</p>\n<p>Mastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments, you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.</p>\n<p>From the first year you will be engaged in a collaborative work, both in tutorials and laboratories. With your study progression, you become exposed to less structured activities, such as individual or group-based research projects, and formal and informal presentations. There are many instances of blended learning activities, including a combination of online and face-to-face modes, or group and/or one-to-one activities are combined.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the program the Capstone unit of study allows you to integrate your skills and knowledge, applied to real-life problems.</p>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Bachelor of Science is a broad-ranging degree allowing you to follow a path to suit your intended career in the sciences. The specialisation will provide both deep and broad coverage of its area, from foundational topics through to advanced studies.</p>\n<p>Core units in the degree will address the quantitative skills needed by all scientists. Scientists need to be able to understand, analyze and communicate data.</p>\n<p>Critical employability skills will be addressed both in the core units and through embedded learning in the discipline units of the specialisations.</p>\n<p>By providing both in-depth discipline education as well as the broader skills required by all scientists the degree will provide a world class science education.</p>\n<p>The Bachelor of Science will help you develop skills such as problem solving and critical thinking through practical work and peer-assisted learning. Our science staff are recognised for their excellence in teaching and many are known internationally for their research, ensuring you are taught with the most up-to-date scientific knowledge.<br />More information can be found in the information on the individual specialisations.</p>\n<p>While currently the only the specialisation to be offered through OUA is Biology, if this is successful, more specialisations will be offered.</p>\n<p>Bachelor of Science (OUA) students will be qualified with the award of Bachelor of Science.</p>",

Assessment tasks are intended both to measure individual progress and provide you with information and guidance on your development.</p>\n<p>Our assessments are designed not only to test students’ discipline-specific knowledge and skills, but also their ability to integrate and analyse information to solve real-world problems. Assessments are spread throughout semester to enable students to build confidence and gain feedback as they learn. In addition to formal assessments, students are provided with regular informal feedback on their progress. This is done through activities that involve self- and peer-evaluation, as well as through our strong student support system of tutors and academic advisors.</p>\n<p>Assessment types used include (but are not limited to) problem solving, laboratory work and reports, oral presentations, essays, active participation in lectures and/or tutorials, online quizzes, individual and group projects and multi-media presentations (posters, videos, blogs). Formal examinations are part of the assessment of the majority of units and involve solving of problems appropriate for the scope and level of the unit.</p>\n<p>Standards and criteria for coursework, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide or may be made available via the university learning management system. Assessment is undertaken by academic staff, demonstrators and tutors. In some cases peer assessment will contribute to the grade.</p>\n<p>Where group work is involved, a self-reflection and peer assessment/feedback in the form of contribution to the assessment task may be incorporated into the requirements of the assessment so that your individual contribution can be identified.</p>",
