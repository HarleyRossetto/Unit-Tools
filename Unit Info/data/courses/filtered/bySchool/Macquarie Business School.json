      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>Throughout the Bachelor of Applied Finance (BAppFin), students will participate in a range of traditional and innovative learning activities designed to develop the knowledge, understanding, skills and techniques required for successful participation in employment or further study. Learning activities are varied and include both formal and informal experiences.</p>\n<p>All units in the program are supported by an online environment that provides access to resources such as lecture notes and recordings, readings, quizzes, discussion forums and assessment materials, and that facilitates communication between teaching staff and students.</p>\n<p>The learning outcomes associated with individual units in the BAppFin have been aligned with course level learning outcomes and the Macquarie University graduate capabilities. Students are expected to actively engage in their learning and work with their lecturers, tutors and fellow students to achieve these learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>Learning styles used in the BAppFin may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case studies or simulations, which provide students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge to real or simulated scenarios in individual or group situations. </li>\n<li>Project work, which may be independent or involve group learning. Projects assist students in developing more in-depth knowledge and skills in conducting research, communication, and in planning, organisation and time management.</li>\n<li>Readings taken from textbooks, journals, websites and other sources provide material to further develop concepts and knowledge referred to in individual units in the program.</li>\n<li>Reflective activities, such as journals, which assist students in integrating the course content and in developing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from the learning environment into the workplace. </li>\n<li>Self-study activities, such as questions with worked examples, (non assessed) online quizzes, and textbook questions and answers.</li>\n<li>Online discussion forums, in which students may be required to submit responses to a given question, and/or to participate in a set discussion topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning in the BAppFin may be facilitated through the following teaching methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures: lectures provide insight into key concepts and understanding of the subject matter pertaining to a unit of study. Extensive use is made of the Echo 360 lecture audio recording system, and lectures may also be video captured. This means that students can usually access lecture material, in some format, on an 'on demand' basis. </li>\n<li>Tutorials: tutorials are classes in which a tutor facilitates interactive learning with a small group of students. In first year, tutorials tend to focus on ensuring that fundamental concepts and skills are acquired. As students progress on to units at a higher level, the focus shifts towards a more critical engagement with the discipline. </li>\n<li>Computer lab workshops or Practicals: the environment in which our graduates will work is one requiring high level quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions. These sessions allow students to acquire and practice quantitative skills that are highly valued in the workplace. In addition to formal workshop sessions under the direct instruction of a lecturer or tutor, students are able to access the labs to practice skills and to complete assessment tasks in their own time. </li>\n<li>PACE (Professional and Community Engagement) is Macquarie University's way of connecting students with partner organisations to provide a mutually beneficial experience. The BAppFin PACE unit, AFIN3010 Issues in Applied Finance takes the form of engagement with industry professionals from various industries including financial planning, investment consulting firms, construction companies who work with the unit convenor is developing hands on projects and assignments for students. These projects are based on what would be expected of a student in their first year of work. In a typical semester practitioners deliver 6 to 8 hrs lectures on campus based on specialised topics which demonstrate and discuss the skills required in completing projects in these areas. Students are then given projects some of which are completed in groups and individually. </li>\n<li>PAL sessions: the Faculty of Business and Economics also offers PAL (Peer Assisted Learning) workshops in a number of first and second year units. The free, weekly PAL workshops are led by trained students who have excelled in those particular units, and are open to all enrolled students in these units. The purpose of PAL is to promote improved learning and understanding of the unit's content in a group setting.</li>\n</ul>",

The videos are designed to activate learners to conduct background research independently and use approaches such as problem-based/enquiry-based learning in order to unpack topics via real-life and current issues faced by global businesses.</p>\n<p>Students attend weekly live events online in which they collaborate with the unit instructor and their peers. Team work is supported through industry-standard collaboration and meeting tools. Throughout each term, students tackle two assignments in which they apply their knowledge to business challenges and critically reflect on current management theories and frameworks.</p>\n<p>Student learning is underpinned by required and optional readings (e.g. theory, case studies), formative assessments (e.g.short recall quizzes), student-to-student interaction (via discussion prompts and instant messaging), student presentations on video (peer-to-peer), and summative assessments (e.g. case study analysis, professional reflections, marketing plans, etc).

Throughout the MAppEcon course, students will participate in a range of traditional and innovative learning activities designed to develop the knowledge, understanding, skills and techniques required for employment and career advancement.</p>\n<p>Learning activities are varied and include both formal and informal experiences. Many units in the course are supported by an online environment that provides access to resources such as lecture material and recordings, readings, quizzes, discussion forums and journals, and that facilitates communication between teaching staff and students.</p>\n<p>Learning styles used in the MAppEcon may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case studies, which provide students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge to real or simulated scenarios in individual or group situations.</li>\n<li>Simulations, modelled on real-life situations and providing learning experiences that promote integration of knowledge, skills and critical thinking.</li>\n<li>Project work, which may be independent or involve group learning. Projects assist students in developing more in-depth knowledge and skills in conducting research, in communication, and in planning, organisation and time management.</li>\n<li>Readings taken from textbooks, journals, websites and other sources provide material to further develop concepts and knowledge referred to in individual units in the course.</li>\n<li>Reflective activities, such as journals, assist students in integrating the course content and in developing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from the learning environment into the workplace.</li>\n<li>Self-study activities, such as questions with worked examples, online quizzes, and textbook questions and answers.</li>\n<li>Online discussion forums, in which students may be required to submit responses to set questions, and/or to participate in a set discussion topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning in the MAppEcon may be facilitated through the following teaching methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures or Seminars: lectures and seminars are presentations designed to communicate a body of knowledge to students and provide insight into key concepts and understanding of the subject matter relating to the unit of study. Lectures and seminars in this course are typically delivered in the traditional face-to-face mode and are generally interactive, with students participating in discussions or other learning activities during the class. They may be recorded using the Echo 360 lecture audio recording system, enabling students to access lecture material on an 'on demand' basis.</li>\n<li>Tutorials: tutorial classes, designed for interactive learning with a small group of students, may also be scheduled in a number of units in the course. Tutorials provide students with the chance to ask questions, seek clarification, resolve problems, enhance their communication skills, and develop their ability to work in a collaborative manner with their peers.</li>\n<li>Computer lab workshops or practicals: the environment in which our graduates will work is one requiring high level quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The inclusion of the Capstone unit ECON8030 in the MAppEcon provides students with opportunities to integrate and synthesise their knowledge and experiences from across the whole course in preparation for the next stage of their professional careers.</p>",

Case studies are used to assess critical thinking, analytical and research skills.</li>\n<li>Assignments, in a variety of formats such as the analysis of a data set, or a brief written response to a topic question.</li>\n<li>Online quizzes, designed to assess knowledge, skills or capabilities, and typically consisting of a series of questions requiring brief responses.</li>\n<li>Class participation, including engagement in seminar or tutorial discussions, or online discussions.</li>\n<li>Written class tests, time limited assessments designed to assess a student’s knowledge or skills.</li>\n<li>Individual or group oral presentations which may incorporate presentation technologies or be accompanied by handouts.</li>\n<li>Final examination, an invigilated assessment conducted at the end of session and designed to assess a student’s body of knowledge and critical thinking skills.</li>\n</ul>",

The assessments have been carefully designed to align with the learning outcomes for the particular units and they address a current problem in International Business and World Affairs.</p>\n<p>The assessment tasks are designed to develop formative and assess summative learning and will require students to integrate and exhibit their skills and knowledge acquired. For each unit students will complete between two to four assessment tasks and the unit guide will indicate the relationship between the assessment tasks, course learning outcomes and graduate capabilities met.</p>\n<p>Assessments are based on the submission of individual and group coursework. Students will complete a variety of assessment tasks over the duration of the course including assessed coursework, class participation, final examination, essay, reports, class test, quiz, presentation, assignment, case study, video consulting online, online forums on current issues in International Business, experiential exercises. Clear standards and criteria for assessments, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide.</p>\n<p>Assessment tasks across the course may include the following:</p>\n<p>Written assessments in traditional academic format ranging from short essays to longer reports, consultation reports, self-directed research papers, literature reviews, case studies or reports, written documents outlining the results of a detailed analysis of a situation or a problem-solving in a large multinational organisation using empirical data and research. Case studies are used to assess critical thinking, analytical and research skill.</p>\n<p>Online quizzes designed to assess knowledge, skills or capabilities, and typically consisting of a series of questions requiring brief responses.</p>\n<p>Class participation, including engagement in tutorial discussions or online discussions.</p>\n<p>Participation in Online forums</p>\n<p>Written class tests, time-limited assessments designed to assess a student's knowledge or skills.</p>\n<p>Individual or group oral presentations which may incorporate presentation technologies or be accompanied by handouts.</p>\n<p>Final examination, invigilated assessments conducted at the end of the session and designed to assess a student's body of knowledge and critical thinking skills.</p>\n<p>Feedback on your performance in completing an assessment task will be provided in a variety of formats in units across the course. Students will complete a number of units in which the final grade awarded to them will be based on your performance in assessment tasks completed within all units within their course.</p>",

However, lectures are not purely passive experiences, and in many units students will be given problems to work on before the lecturer summarises the main issues of the problem.</p>\n<p>Tutorials are smaller classes where students get to work on various problems and seek feedback from their tutor. Tutorials allow a level of feedback not possible in the larger lectures.</p>\n<p>Practicals are usually held in computer laboratories and allow students to gain experience with relevant statistical software.</p>\n<p>While the majority of classes are taught by university staff, several units also employ presentations by industry practitioners. This is particularly so in the course's capstone unit, which is also a PACE (Participation and Community Engagement) unit. This unit involves extensive presentations by industry partners, who are also involved and assessing and providing feedback on a major assessment task where students tackle a real world project and provide a verbal presentation on their findings.</p>",

      "assessment": "<p>Most units in the program include regular tutorial exercises which are designed for students to test their own understanding. These are formative and are not assessed. There are also a range of assessment tasks which are used to determine students' grades.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Final Exam: this program is accredited by the Actuaries Institute, the Australian professional actuarial body. To assist in meeting accreditation requirements, many units in the program have an assessment scheme strongly weighted towards a final exam. A unit's final examination is designed to assess a student's command of the entire unit's knowledge and skills. While multiple choice questions are used in some units, most exam questions require longer written answers, which may be either mathematical in nature or word-based. Actuaries do not work in isolation but rather need to be able to explain their results to members of other professions, so exam questions do include scenarios requiring non-technical explanations of the meaning of calculations.</li>\n<li>Tests: class tests are held during class time under normal exam conditions. They allow students to practice their exam skills in preparation for the final exam.</li>\n<li>Assignments: an assignment may take a variety of formats such as the analysis of data using a spreadsheet or statistical software, the development of a mathematical argument, or the production of a formal report explaining the results of any of the previous items.</li>\n<li>Quizzes: a quiz is an online assessment. Quizzes usually consist of a short series of questions which may be true/false, multiple choice, or require students to enter a numerical answer. Quizzes are usually computer-marked, their main advantage being their ability to provide fast feedback to students.</li>\n<li>Presentations: presentations may be conducted on an individual or group basis. Traditionally they have involved a live oral presentation with appropriate visual aids, but looking forward they may allow students to develop a video presentation.</li>\n</ul>",

However, lectures are not purely passive experiences, and in many units students will be given problems to work on and discuss in groups before the lecturer summarises the main issues of the problem.</p>\n<p>Tutorials are smaller classes where students get to work at their own pace on various problems and seek feedback from their tutor. Tutorials allow a level of feedback not possible in the larger lectures.</p>\n<p>Practicals are usually held in computer laboratories and allow students to gain experience with relevant statistical software.</p>\n<p>While the majority of the above classes are taught by university staff, several units also employ presentations by industry practitioners. This is particularly so in the Capstone unit, which is also a PACE (Professional and Community Engagement) unit, and involves extensive presentations by industry partners, who are also involved and assessing and providing feedback on a major assessment task where students tackle a real world project and provide an oral presentation on their findings.</p>\n<p>Vocational placements in the Professional Practice component involve an extensive period working in a workplace setting. Students work on practical problems under the guidance of a supervisor. The staggered sequence of three placements allows students to apply knowledge and skills developed in the classroom to new and authentic workplace experiences over the course of their program. Workshops and online curriculum enable students to reflect on and articulate how 'theory and practice' work together, enhancing students' capacity for life-long, self-directed learning. The sequence of vocational placements also offers students the opportunity to explore career options in different areas of the actuarial profession and different types of firms, and to network with a range of industry partners.</p>\n<p>Seminars are offered in units that contain vocational placements. Seminars cover information relevant to succeeding in the workplace, such as adapting to a new office environment, business communication, business ethics, reflection for further learning, soft skill development and translating work experiences into materials relevant for future job searches.</p>",

It provides an opportunity to obtain exemption from the foundation level professional exams of the Australian Actuaries Institute and the UK's Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. The course also offers students the opportunity to participate in Macquarie's cooperative education program (Co-op). Students will alternate between classroom studies and workplace experience in the form of three work placements of three to six months each throughout their course to develop professional skills and networks across different workplace settings and use their practical experiences in the classroom.</p>",

There are also a range of assessment tasks which are used to determine students' grades.</p>\n<p>1. Final Exam. This course is accredited by the Actuaries Institute, the Australian professional actuarial body. To assist in meeting accreditation requirements, many units in the program have an assessment scheme strongly weighted towards a final exam. A unit's final examination is designed to assess a student's command of the entire unit's knowledge and skills. While multiple choice questions are used in some units, most exam questions require longer written answers, which may be either mathematical in nature or word-based. Actuaries do not work in isolation but rather need to be able to explain their results to members of other professions, so exam questions do include scenarios requiring non-technical explanations of the meaning of calculations.</p>\n<p>2. Assignments: An assignment may take a variety of formats such as the analysis of data using a spreadsheet or statistical software, the development of a mathematical argument, or the production of a formal report explaining the results of any of the previous items.</p>\n<p>3. Quizzes: A quiz is an online assessment. Quizzes usually consist of a short series of questions which may be true/false, multiple choice, or require students to enter a numerical answer. Quizzes are usually computer-marked, their main advantage being their ability to provide fast feedback to students.</p>\n<p>4. Presentations: Presentations may be conducted on an individual or group basis. Traditionally they have involved a live oral presentation with appropriate visual aids, but looking forward they may allow students to develop a video presentation.</p>\n<p>5. Tests: Class tests are held during class time under normal exam conditions. They allow students to practice their exam skills in preparation for the final exam.</p>\n<p>6. Reports: Extended written work. These will form a key part of the assessment for the work placements.</p>\n<p>In the Professional Practice component of the course, indicative assessment tasks include:</p>\n<p>7. In consecutive placements throughout the course, students will participate in learning and teaching activities and complete tasks in which they critically reflect on their application of disciplinary knowledge in the workplace, lessons learned regarding communication with different audiences, personal and professional skill development, professional judgment, application of workplace knowledge and skills in their academic programs, etc. With each successive placement, students will scaffold skills both in reflection and in these knowledge and skill areas.</p>\n<p>8. Reports addressing aspects of professional behaviour in the workplace, such as adhering to ethical standards, sustainable practice, social inclusion and global citizenship. Knowledge and application of professional behaviour is scaffolded throughout the course.</p>\n<p>9. Presentations and/or reports to deliver on projects completed in the workplace.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The Bachelor of Economics utilizes a range of learning and teaching methods to allow students to achieve the course level outcomes, and may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures: intended to present information or teach students about a particular subject. While lectures in this course are typically delivered in the traditional face-to-face mode, extensive use is also made of the Echo 360 lecture recording system. Many lectures, where technically possible, are also video captured. </li>\n<li>Tutorials: classes in which a tutor facilitates interactive learning with a small group of students. At the 1000 level, tutorials tend to focus on ensuring that fundamental concepts and skills are acquired. As students progress to 2000 and 3000 level, the focus of tutorials shifts towards a more critical engagement with the discipline. Tutorials provide students with the chance to ask questions, seek clarification, resolve problems, practice communication skills and develop their ability to work in a collaborative manner with others.</li>\n<li>Workshops: the environment in which BEc graduates will work is one requiring high level quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions. In addition to formal workshop sessions under the direct instruction of a lecturer or tutor, students are able to access these computer labs to practice skills and to complete assessment tasks outside formal class time. </li>\n<li>Participation and Community Engagement (PACE). The BEc aims to produce work ready graduates. To this end all students complete a Capstone unit in their final year of study, which draws together the various strands of knowledge that have been developed across the course and emphasises the application of this knowledge to real world situations. The Capstone also includes an emphasis on PACE. This takes the form of sustained serious engagement with industry partners. These industry partners present lectures in which real world projects are posed to students. Students work on these projects in groups, under close supervision from lecturing staff and the industry partners.</li>\n</ul>",

Formative assessment provides students with feedback on their learning, but which is often not graded, or makes a small contribution to the final grade. Summative assessment gives students a judgement on their learning, for grading purposes.</p>\n<p>The types of assessment tasks employed in the BEc may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essays: an essay requires the systematic investigation of a topic and the development of a written argument. In addition to assessing the acquisition of discipline specific knowledge and skills, essays are also used to assess other course objectives relating to cognitive, communication and research skills.</li>\n<li>Assignments: An assignment may take a variety of formats ranging from the production of an Excel spreadsheet, the analysis of data, a written response to a topic question, or presenting a solution to an analytical problem.</li>\n<li>Quizzes: a quiz is an online assessment. In the BEc, quizzes are typically used to assess discipline specific knowledge and skills. Quizzes usually consist of a short series of questions requiring a brief response. They also commonly take the form of multiple choice questions and provide timely formative feedback to students.</li>\n<li>Presentations: presentations may be conducted on an individual or group basis. They involve the oral description of an area of investigation and may utilise a range of presentation technologies and supplementary materials such as handouts. Presentations typically provide the audience with the opportunity to ask questions. This form of assessment is crucial in the development of the important course objectives relating to communication. Feedback is typically provided verbally and in writing. Feedback from peers is also sometimes provided.</li>\n<li>Class participation: class participation is assessed by a student's engagement in discussions facilitated by a lecturer or tutor, contributions to online discussion forums, or general questions asked during lectures and tutorials. Participation is expected to be well considered and relevant to the topic.</li>\n<li>Final examination: a final examination is designed to assess a student's body of knowledge and critical thinking skills. Examinations consist of questions requiring written responses. These questions may be in a multiple choice format, or require short answers or short essay responses. Most units in the BEc have a final examination. The final examination is typically given the heaviest weighting in the assessment scheme.</li>\n</ul>",

Throughout the MCom program, students will participate in a range of traditional and innovative learning activities designed to develop the knowledge, understanding, skills and techniques required for successful participation in employment.</p>\n<p>Learning activities are varied and include both formal and informal experiences. Many units in the program are supported by an online environment that provides access to resources such as lecture notes and recordings, readings, quizzes, discussion forums and assessment materials, and that facilitates communication between teaching staff and students.</p>\n<p>The learning outcomes associated with individual units in the MCom have been aligned with program level learning outcomes and the Macquarie University graduate capabilities. Students are expected to actively engage in their learning and work with their teaching staff and fellow students to achieve these learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>Learning styles used in the MCom may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case studies, which provide students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge to real or simulated scenarios in individual or group situations.</li>\n<li>Simulations, modelled on real-life situations and providing learning experiences that promote integration of knowledge, skills and critical thinking.</li>\n<li>Project work, which may be independent or involve group learning. Projects assist students in developing more in-depth knowledge and skills in conducting research, communication, and in planning, organisation and energy and time management.</li>\n<li>Readings taken from textbooks, journals, websites and other sources provide material to further develop concepts and knowledge referred to in individual units in the program.</li>\n<li>Reflective activities, such as journals, assist students in integrating the course content and in developing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from the learning environment into the workplace.</li>\n<li>Self-study activities, such as questions with worked examples, (non assessed) online quizzes, and textbook questions and answers.</li>\n<li>Online discussion forums, in which students may be required to submit responses to a given question, and/or to participate in a set discussion topics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning in the MCom may be facilitated through the following teaching methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures or Seminars: lectures and seminars are presentations designed to communicate a body of knowledge to a group of students and provide insight into key concepts and understanding of the subject matter relating to the unit of study. Lectures and seminars in this program are typically delivered in the traditional face-to-face mode and are generally interactive, with students participating in discussions or other learning activities during the session. They may be recorded using the Echo 360 lecture audio recording system, enabling students to access lecture material on an 'on demand' basis.</li>\n<li>Computer lab workshops or practicals: the environment in which our graduates will work is one requiring quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions. These sessions allow students to acquire and practice quantitative skills that are highly valued in the workplace.</li>\n</ul>",

Formative assessment provides students with feedback on their learning, but is sometimes not graded, or makes a small contribution to the final grade. Summative assessment gives students a judgement on their learning, for grading purposes.</p>\n<p>The types of assessment tasks employed in the MCom are diverse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essays: an essay requires the systematic investigation of a topic and the development of a written argument. In addition to assessing the acquisition of discipline specific knowledge and skills, essays are also used to assess other program objectives relating to cognitive, communication and research skills. Essays in the MCom tend to be between 1500 and 3000 words in length. </li>\n<li>Independent Research Projects: some units in the MCom include a substantial independent research project. </li>\n<li>Assignments: an assignment may take a variety of formats ranging from the production of an Excel spreadsheet, the analysis of data, a written response to a topic question, or presenting a solution to an analytical problem. </li>\n<li>Quizzes: a quiz is an offline or online assessment. In the MCom, quizzes are typically used to assess discipline specific knowledge and skills. Quizzes usually consist of a short series of questions requiring a brief response. They also commonly take the form of multiple choice questions. Quizzes are used widely across the program. They provide timely, formative feedback to students.</li>\n<li>Presentations: presentations may be conducted on an individual or group basis. They involve the oral description of an area of investigation and may utilise a range of presentation technologies and supplementary materials such as handouts. Presentations typically provide the audience with the opportunity to ask questions. The presenter(s) is expected to provide an informed response. This form of assessment is crucial in the development of the important program objectives relating to communication. Feedback is typically (but not always) provided verbally and in writing. Feedback from peers is also sometimes provided.</li>\n<li>Class participation: class participation is assessed by a student's engagement in discussions facilitated by a lecturer, contributions to online discussion forums, or general questions asked during lectures and seminars. Participation is expected to be well considered and relevant to the topic. Participation is also linked to attendance &ndash; it a student is not present, they can not participate.</li>\n<li>Final examination: the final examination is designed to assess a student's body of knowledge and critical thinking skills. Examinations consist of questions requiring written responses. These questions may be in a multiple choice format, or require short answers or short essay responses. Most units in the MCom have a final examination. The final examination is typically given the heaviest weighting in the assessment scheme.</li>\n</ul>",

They cover information relevant to succeeding in the workplace, such as adapting to a new office environment, business communication, business ethics, reflection for further learning, soft skill development and translating placement experiences into materials relevant for future job searches.</li>\n<li>Online modules support students to engage with topics relevant to succeeding and learning from their placement experience (e.g., project management or leadership). The modules are designed to introduce a topic and provide a structure for students to apply what they are learning about the topic through the experience of the placement.</li>\n<li>Vocational placements in the Professional Practice component of the double degree involve an extensive period of training in a workplace setting. Students work on practical problems under the guidance of a supervisor. The staggered sequence of three vocational placements allows students to apply knowledge and skills developed in the classroom to new and authentic workplace experiences over the course of their course. Workshops and online curriculum support and enable students to reflect on and articulate how &ldquo;theory and practice&rdquo; work together, enhancing students&rsquo; capacity for life-long, self-directed learning.

Many units in the program are supported by an online environment that provides access to resources such as lecture notes and recordings, readings, quizzes, discussion forums and assessment materials, and that facilitates communication between teaching staff and students.</p>\n<p>The learning outcomes associated with individual units in the BCom have been aligned with program level learning outcomes and the Macquarie University graduate capabilities. Students are expected to actively engage in their learning and work with their teaching staff and fellow students to achieve these learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>Learning styles used in the BCom may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case studies, which provide students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge to real or simulated scenarios in individual or group situations.</li>\n<li>Simulations, modelled on real-life situations and providing learning experiences that promote integration of knowledge, skills and critical thinking.</li>\n<li>Project work, which may be independent or involve group learning. Projects assist students in developing more in-depth knowledge and skills in conducting research, communication, and in planning, organisation and energy and time management.</li>\n<li>Readings taken from textbooks, journals, websites and other sources provide material to further develop concepts and knowledge referred to in individual units in the program.</li>\n<li>Reflective activities, such as journals, assist students in integrating the course content and in developing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from the learning environment into the workplace.</li>\n<li>Self-study activities, such as questions with worked examples, (non assessed) online quizzes, and textbook questions and answers.</li>\n<li>Online discussion forums, in which students may be required to submit responses to a given question, and/or to participate in a set discussion topics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning in the BCom may be facilitated through the following teaching methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures or Seminars: lectures and seminars are presentations designed to communicate a body of knowledge to a group of students and provide insight into key concepts and understanding of the subject matter relating to the unit of study. Lectures and seminars in this program are typically delivered in the traditional face-to-face mode and are generally interactive, with students participating in discussions or other learning activities during the session. They may be recorded using the Echo 360 lecture audio recording system, enabling students to access lecture material on an 'on demand' basis.</li>\n<li>Computer lab workshops or practicals: the environment in which our graduates will work is one requiring quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions. These sessions allow students to acquire and practice quantitative skills that are highly valued in the workplace.</li>\n</ul>",

Many units in the program are supported by an online environment that provides access to resources such as lecture notes and recordings, readings, quizzes, discussion forums and assessment materials, and that facilitates communication between teaching staff and students.</p>\n<p>Learning styles used in the Graduate Certificate in Commerce may include:<br />o Case studies, which provide students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge to real or simulated scenarios in individual or group situations.<br />o Simulations, modelled on real-life situations and providing learning experiences that promote integration of knowledge, skills and critical thinking.<br />o Project work, which may be independent or involve group learning. Projects assist students in developing more in-depth knowledge and skills in conducting research, communication, and in planning, organisation and energy and time management.<br />o Readings taken from textbooks, journals, websites and other sources provide material to further develop concepts and knowledge referred to in individual units in the program.<br />o Reflective activities, such as journals, assist students in integrating the course content and in developing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from the learning environment into the workplace.<br />o Self-study activities, such as questions with worked examples, (non assessed) online quizzes, and textbook questions and answers.<br />o Online discussion forums, in which students may be required to submit responses to a given question, and/or to participate in a set discussion topics.</p>\n<p>Learning in the Graduate Certificate in Commerce may be facilitated through the following teaching methods:<br />o Lectures or Seminars: lectures and seminars are presentations designed to communicate a body of knowledge to a group of students and provide insight into key concepts and understanding of the subject matter relating to the unit of study. Lectures and seminars in this program are typically delivered in the traditional face-to-face mode and are generally interactive, with students participating in discussions or other learning activities during the session. They may be recorded using the Echo 360 lecture audio recording system, enabling students to access lecture material on an 'on demand' basis.<br />o Computer lab workshops or practicals: the environment in which our graduates will work is one requiring quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions. These sessions allow students to acquire and practice quantitative skills that are highly valued in the workplace.</p>",

      "learning_and_teaching_methods": "<p>The GradDipAppFin offers an opportunity for finance industry professionals to study at an advanced level without necessarily taking the full Master of Applied Finance (MAppFin) course. The course is structured to allow students to develop specialised knowledge in a sharply focused field. Students sit alongside our MAppFin participants, taking the same classes and sitting the same assessments. The learning and teaching methods applicable to the GradDipAppFin are identical to those of the MAppFin.</p>\n<p>Our learning and teaching strategies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Applied&quot; Focus: the GradDipAppFin is a practitioner-oriented course. While academically rigorous, it has a strong practical emphasis with a strong focus on &quot;real world&quot; issues. It focuses directly on how finance is practiced today and provides the conceptual framework to allow you to understand and influence what happens tomorrow.</li>\n<li>Quality Teaching Faculty: our faculty members include industry practitioners and experienced academics with substantial hands-on industry experience, adding a uniquely practical edge to their teaching.</li>\n<li>Focus on Real World Finance: we are committed to making sure that students gain knowledge and skills that are relevant in today's financial environment. Our course structure and content have been designed to ensure that you learn how finance works in the world, not just in theory. Our teaching faculty share insights from their own careers and use a range of case studies to highlight important concepts.</li>\n<li>Student Experience: students have two or more years of relevant work experience, meaning that you learn from each others' experiences as well as those of the teaching faculty. We only accept students who are able to add value to the group and contribute generously to discussions.</li>\n<li>Content: our course combines depth of content and breadth of subject areas. With an unparalleled range of electives around a rigorous core curriculum, we provide an individualised learning experience targeting your own real-world career plans.</li>\n<li>Flexible: you set the pace at which you progress through the course, affording you the greatest level of flexibility. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>These strategies are applied utilising the following key teaching methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures: the GradDipAppFin is taught in modern classrooms utilising interactive technologies. You are encouraged to &quot;BYOD&quot; (Bring Your Own Device) which supports real-time teaching aids using technology, when solving problems or understanding models. Case study analysis is a key component of the curriculum, as you genuinely apply your understanding of finance to real-world issues.</li>\n<li>On-line classes and activities: you will have access to a variety of on-line resources to facilitate and enrich your learning process. Units in the course make use of on-line resources such as webinars, lecture recordings and notes, learning activities, spreadsheet models, discussion forums, readings, video clips, links to external resources and sample exams.</li>\n<li>Independent Learning: you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of self-directed study and research projects.</li>\n<li>Group Learning: you will have the opportunity to engage in on-line discussion forums, peer review and reflective exercises. Selected tasks may involve group work, enabling collaborative and creative approaches to deconstructing and solving problems.</li>\n<li>Feedback: you will receive formative feedback from lecturers to monitor performance and indicate improvements necessary.</li>\n</ul>",
      "overview_and_aims_of_the_course": "<p>The Graduate Diploma of Applied Finance (GradDipAppFin) is part of a suite of courses structured around the Master of Applied Finance (MAppFin).

They gain a thorough understanding of the field through their study of core and elective units to explore their areas of interest in greater detail from a range of perspectives. Units are offered throughout the full calendar year, both inside and outside traditional university sessions. The curriculum delivers a hybrid model of online interactive learning together with face-to-face classes and workshops.<br />Students who successfully complete the GradDipAppFin are able to articulate to the MAppFin.

The course is multidisciplinary in its content and covers statistical theory, financial reporting, economics, financial mathematics, life insurance mathematics, general insurance mathematics, financial economics, survival analysis, actuarial modeling, data science / analytics, and units covering application of the knowledge and skills to the management of financial institutions, development of new products, financial measurement, regulation, ethics, marketing etc. The course covers the core technical knowledge and skills, along with application of these to financial institution management.</p>",

      "graduate_destinations_and_employability": "<p>Graduate destinations include Life Insurance, General Insurance, Superannuation and Retirement Funds, Banks, Financial Software Developers, Big 4 Accounting firms, banks, investment banks, actuarial consultants, Reinsurance companies and government departments (e.g. ATO, Government Actuary's Office, Treasury, etc)</p>\n<p>Graduates from our course are prepared for the world of work, particularly in the financial sector, via the highly applied focus of the content covered, and the problem solving, critical thinking and communication skills they acquire during the course. In the same way that accounting graduates need to complete their &quot;professional year&quot; (which is often several years) via their accounting professional society after completing their undergraduate degree, Actuarial graduates also complete several years of post-university professional study and exams (while working) to become fully qualified Fellows of the actuarial profession. Our graduates are well positioned to complete this post university study.</p>",

Many units in the course are supported by an online environment that provides access to resources such as lecture notes and recordings, readings, quizzes, discussion forums and assessment materials, and that facilitates communication between teaching staff and students.</p>\n<p>Learning styles used may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case studies, which provide students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge to real or simulated scenarios in individual or group situations.</li>\n<li>Simulations, modelled on real-life situations and providing learning experiences that promote integration of knowledge, skills and critical thinking.</li>\n<li>Project work, which may be independent or involve group learning. Projects assist students in developing more in-depth knowledge and skills in conducting research, communication, and in planning, organisation and time management.</li>\n<li>Readings taken from textbooks, journals, websites and other sources provide material to further develop concepts and knowledge referred to in individual units in the course.</li>\n<li>Reflective activities, such as journals, assist students in integrating the course content and in developing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from the learning environment into the workplace.</li>\n<li>Self-study activities, such as questions with worked examples, online quizzes, and textbook questions and answers.</li>\n<li>Online discussion forums, in which students may be required to submit responses to set questions, and/or to participate in a set discussion topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning in the Master of Finance may be facilitated through the following teaching methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures or Seminars: Lectures and seminars are presentations designed to communicate a body of knowledge to a group of students and provide insight into key concepts and understanding of the subject matter relating to the unit of study. Lectures and seminars in this course are typically delivered in the traditional face-to-face mode and are generally interactive, with students participating in discussions or other learning activities during the class. They may be recorded using the Echo 360 lecture audio recording system, enabling students to access lecture material on an 'on demand' basis.</li>\n<li>Tutorials: Tutorial classes, designed for interactive learning with a small group of students, may also be scheduled in a number of units in the course. Tutorials provide students with the chance to ask questions, seek clarification, resolve problems, enhance their communication skills, and develop their ability to work in a collaborative manner with their peers.</li>\n<li>Computer lab workshops or practicals: The environment in which our graduates will work is one requiring high level quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions.</li>\n</ul>",

Team work is supported through industry-standard collaboration and meeting tools. Throughout each term, students tackle two assignments in which they apply their knowledge to business challenges and critically reflect on current management theories and frameworks.</p>\n<p>Student learning is underpinned by required and optional readings (e.g. theory, case studies), formative assessments (e.g.short recall quizzes), student-to-student interaction (via discussion prompts and instant messaging), student presentations on video (peer-to-peer), and summative assessments (e.g. case study analysis, professional reflections, marketing plans, etc).
