This unit prioritises Indigenous Queer populations as agents of transformation across social, cultural, and political landscapes of Australia and across the globe. Through critical engagement with Indigenous LGBTIQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, and Queer) worldviews, students will develop an understanding of Indigenous Queer identities and explore the specific challenges that these communities continue to endure under colonial regimes. We will engage in Indigenous Queer perspectives which interrupt, challenge, enrich and recalibrate our understandings of community, culture, gender, and sexuality.",
