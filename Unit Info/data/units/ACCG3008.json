The first component examines the framework and techniques that are used to prepare general purpose financial reports for companies, and in particular the techniques used to prepare the consolidated financial statements for a corporate group. This component builds on first and second year financial accounting units and provides students with the technical accounting knowledge to prepare and use company financial statements. Political and ethical issues surrounding recent financial reporting controversies are also considered. The second component introduces students to the perspective of acting as a trusted business advisor. This component builds on prior knowledge of accounting, accounting information systems, compliance and business strategy, and applies these skills in a real-world setting. Both components of the unit develop graduate capabilities centred on higher order analysis and effective communication skills.",
