This unit provides a systematic and critical analysis of the issues related to the integration of management accounting and control systems with strategy implementation. Strategy is initially discussed as a topic in its own right, followed by an examination of how various strategic choices affect management accounting techniques such as activity-based accounting, variance analysis, and performance evaluation. By the end of this unit students will be able to analyse complex situations and develop approaches that are logical, consistent and defensible from a strategic perspective. The unit uses case studies extensively to develop graduate capabilities centred upon higher order critical analysis skills and the ability of students to generate a range of effective alternative options and innovative solutions to case based scenarios.",
