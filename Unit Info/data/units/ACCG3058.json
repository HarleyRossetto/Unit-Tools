Students will examine the risks associated with information systems using frameworks that provide professional standards, guidelines, tools and techniques for IS audit and control. The risk-based approach to IS audit is developed so that students have an understanding of inherent risks, control risks and detection risks. Students will be exposed to computer auditing tools and techniques that both directly and indirectly examine the internal logic of an organisation&#39;s applications. In this unit students develop graduate capabilities in a range of areas, including: critical analysis skills in information management and analysis; problem-solving skills in sourcing and identifying relevant information and interpreting output in a multidisciplinary environment; and communication and negotiation skills. ",
