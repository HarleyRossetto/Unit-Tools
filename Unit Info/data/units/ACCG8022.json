The aim of the unit is for students to understand the concept of the digital economy, the impact business pressures play on the organisation, and their responses and adaptations to these pressures, and the role ICT plays both inside and outside the organisation in the context of globalisation and future trends. The focus is on understanding the creation of business value by enabling business processes using information and communications technologies. Students will analyse contemporary case studies and examples to critically evaluate and recommend specific ICT solutions for each topic. Students develop report writing skills by researching a current topic, such as cybersecurity or digital ethics, analyse the issues and provide recommendations to management.  <br />The unit is offered in two delivery modes. Students can choose between a face-to-face, on campus offering, over the full session, or an external offering comprising six modules, each of one week&#39;s duration, with a workshop on campus prior to the start of session.  ",
