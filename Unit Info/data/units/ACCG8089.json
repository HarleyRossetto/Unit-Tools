Students will analyse the role of the forensic accountant in the assessment and calculation of loss and damage in relation to negotiation and litigation of disputes. Areas covered include damages for breach of contract, and in negligence, together with the application of other financial remedies such as an account of profits. The unit also focuses on loss and damage in relation to specialised areas such as intellectual property disputes. By the conclusion of the unit students will have developed a good understanding of the legal principles underpinning the quantification of damages and will be able to use and apply relevant techniques in relation to the assessment and calculation of damages and other financial remedies.",
