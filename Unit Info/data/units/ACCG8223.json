Each student will also be required to submit a typed written analysis (maximum 300 words) of the issues, the law and the approach to solving the question that they have been allocated. This typed written analysis (worth 10%) should provide an explanation of the issues arising from the question, the taxation law relevant to those issues, and a suggestion as to how the issues can be solved by application of the law, and is not to be a repeat of the presentation. The written analysis must not include calculations or numerical explanations, and is to be submitted in hardcopy to the lecturer in class on the day of the presentation, as well as via Turnitin on iLearn.
