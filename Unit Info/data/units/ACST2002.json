    "description": "This unit begins with coverage of the basics of data analysis and modelling. It continues with a rigorous mathematical development of compound interest theory, using calculus where appropriate, applying the theory to more complex financial problems. Topics include the force of interest and its relationship to interest rates, inflation and capital gains tax, discrete and continuous term certain annuities, project appraisal, loans, bonds, yield curves, matching and immunisation and the definitions of various insurance and annuity contracts. Students will be required to use an Excel spreadsheet to solve problems throughout the unit. The concepts developed in this unit are required in several subsequent units in the actuarial degree. Students gaining a credit average in both ACST2002 and ACST2055 (minimum mark of 60 on both units) will satisfy the requirements for exemption from the professional subject CM1 of the Actuaries Institute.",
