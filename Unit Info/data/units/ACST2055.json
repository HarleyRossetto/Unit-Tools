    "description": "This unit covers the analysis of cash flows dependent on uncertain events due to mortality and other factors. It introduces the concept of the expected present value of payments under various life insurance contracts, including whole life, term and endowment assurances; immediate and temporary annuities; and deferred assurances and annuities. The standard international actuarial notation in life insurance is used extensively. Probability models and life tables are used to calculate the expected present values accurately based on ultimate or select mortality. Furthermore, important concepts of pricing and reserving for future contingent liabilities are discussed. Equations of value are established to calculate net premiums. Prospective and retrospective net premium reserves required to meet future liabilities are determined and compared. Techniques for the valuation of annuity and assurance products involving two lives are developed. Students gaining a credit average in both ACST2002 and ACST2055 (minimum mark of 60 on both units) will satisfy the requirements for exemption from the professional subject CM1 of the Actuaries Institute.",
