    "description": "This unit provides sophisticated statistical and probabilistic models for survival, sickness, insurance losses and other actuarial problems based on survival data. Techniques of survival analysis are used to estimate survival and loss distributions and evaluate risk factors in actuarial applications. Methods of both nonparametric and parametric estimation are utilised. Advanced models based on Markov chains and processes will be introduced to capture the features of stochastic transitions between different survival or loss states and to estimate the transition rates. Methods for valuing cashflows that are contingent upon multiple transition events and methods of projecting and valuing such expected cashflows will also be covered. Students gaining a weighted average of credit across all of ACST3058, ACST3060 and the CS2-related components of the assessment in ACST3059 (minimum mark of 60% on all three components) will satisfy the requirements for exemption from the professional subject CS2 of the Actuaries Institute.",
