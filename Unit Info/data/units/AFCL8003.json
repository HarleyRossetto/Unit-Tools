There is considerable emphasis on using financial statement information, the preparation of cash flow forecasts, computation of discount rates and the application of various valuation methods. Capital structure is analysed extensively from the viewpoint of its effect on corporate value. Other topics include mergers &amp; acquisitions, fund raising and international investment decisions.",
