    "description": "Financial Risk Management is based on an enterprise risk management framework designed to increase the likelihood that an organisation will achieve its objectives. Unlike traditional, purely defensive approaches to risk, FRM&#39;s philosophy focuses on how effective risk management adds value to the organisation. We consider methods for identifying, assessing and treating a variety of risks, with special focus on market, credit, funding liquidity and operational risks. The unit encompasses both quantitative skills and broader human and organisational issues. We encourage students to question the assumptions behind the models, to think about behavioural biases, to identify ethical issues, to consider incentives, and to think creatively of risk management solutions. The lectures deliver theoretical and industry relevance by using a case study methodology. Lectures are complemented by online learning activities designed to promote student interaction, engagement, and understanding throughout the Unit. Assessable pre-course activities must be completed prior to the first class.",
