Emphasis is placed on being able to interpret financial statements in the context of a company&#39;s operational performance and strategy, to assess historical financial performance and to prepare a spreadsheet based financial model capable of forecasting integrated financial statements for a company. After this unit, students should understand the language of financial statements, and be able to use an Annual Report to develop an understanding of a company&#39;s historical performance and prospects. Specific topics include the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement and financial statement analysis using Dupont methodology. Financial modelling applications will also be developed, so students will be able to prepare forecasts for the three financial statements, as well as being able to integrate the three statements.",
