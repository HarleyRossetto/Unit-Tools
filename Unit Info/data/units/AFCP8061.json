All of these decisions must be made in the context of the company&#39;s operating performance and growth strategies. Taking the CFO perspective, this unit will give students the opportunity to analyse and develop a company&#39;s preferred financial strategy. This unit should appeal to those involved in developing financial strategy for corporations, and investment and corporate bankers who might advise CFO&#39;s on financial strategy. The unit also addresses issues in: managing external stakeholders, particularly investor relations; risk allocation between various stakeholders; and the role of complex financial structures. The unit also equips students to evaluate alternative equity raising and capital management transaction structures. Although the unit will take a strategic perspective, students will be able to develop financial modelling skills to support the necessary analysis.",
