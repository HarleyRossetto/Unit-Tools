Students will develop skills required in the assessment of projects, companies or divisions. This unit will consider in detail the assumptions and implementation issues involved in valuation models, recent developments in cost of capital estimation, valuation methodologies and real options. These principles will then be applied in the valuation of portfolio and controlling interests in both public and private companies. The nuances of performing valuations for mergers and acquisitions vs independent expert’s reports vs financial reporting vs taxation purposes will be assessed.
