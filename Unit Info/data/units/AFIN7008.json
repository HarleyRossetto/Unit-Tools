Following a brief revision of basic financial concepts covered in earlier finance courses, the unit investigates the more complicated theoretical issues and analytical techniques in corporate finance. In particular, a critical approach is adopted which involves identifying the assumptions and limitations of these techniques when applied to the real world. Students are encouraged to understand that often the best method is a matter of debate, and that they must choose a method from a group of methods all of which have various limitations.
