    "description": "The objective of this unit is to explore the theory and application of corporate finance issues at an advanced level, and to equip students with the required depth of knowledge and skill expected of a professional. Following a brief revision of basic financial concepts covered in earlier finance courses, the unit investigates the more complicated theoretical issues and analytical techniques in corporate finance. In particular, a critical approach is adopted which involves identifying the assumptions and limitations of these techniques when applied to the real world. Students are encouraged to understand that often the best method is a matter of debate, and that they must choose a method from a group of methods all of which have various limitations. This critical approach is reinforced by examining a number of real life corporate finance projects.",
