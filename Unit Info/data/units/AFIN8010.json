The unit will introduce methods for evaluating the effects of environmental changes on business, introducing students to tools that will enable them to be intelligent users of risk assessment methodologies. It will also focus on exploring the implications of climate/environmental change for asset impairment, and introduces students to ideas around corporate social responsibility and the applicability to environmental finance. The unit concludes by introducing students to general ideas of how to evaluate adaptation and mitigation investment decisions under conditions of risk and uncertainty. Changing disclosure requirements from the changing environmental landscape are discussed.",
