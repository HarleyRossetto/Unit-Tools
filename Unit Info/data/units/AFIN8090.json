This is an excellent course for students with an interest in a career in corporate finance or financial statement analysis. The modelling and forecasting principles covered in this course are not simply an application of extrapolative techniques to historical data. Rather, there is an emphasis on modelling the uncertainty, and alerting decision makers, of corporate change as the forecast horizon increases. This is very much a hands-on course and the lectures use worked examples throughout, requiring students to be at computer terminals with access to excel and industry standard simulation packages. The worked examples are designed to reinforce the financial modelling and forecasting principles covered in the course.",
