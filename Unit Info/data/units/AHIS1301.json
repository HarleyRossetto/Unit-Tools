Students will examine a range of archaeological material from different parts of the world from prehistory to the early medieval period. By exploring a variety of ancient cultures, students will observe the interdisciplinary approach that contemporary archaeology utilises when facing broader questions such as the origin of the human species, its evolution and its interaction with the natural environment until the emergence of complex societies and then the blooming and diversity of historical societies. The unit will provide a broad knowledge and understanding of past societies, introducing methodology and theoretical issues when necessary.",
