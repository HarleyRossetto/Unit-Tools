Taking as its basis the history of archaeological thought, the unit will expand to address recent discussions and approaches in particular sub-fields, including the theoretical implications of morals, ethics and the exponential growth of scientific technologies. Taking as its mandate inclusivity and diversity, the unit will draw on case studies across cultural and temporal frames.
