    "description": "This unit explores the development of ancient Egyptian culture in its Near Eastern context from the Predynastic period to the end of Late Antiquity (ca. 5000 BCE to 1000 CE) as reflected in the archaeological record. The themes studied will deal with both funerary and settlement archaeology and isolate key developments in burials, dwellings, religious buildings and objects of daily use. The unit will draw on the experience of extensive fieldwork by Macquarie University staff in Egypt and the Near East and incorporates object based learning drawing on the Egyptian antiquities collection in the Macquarie University History Museum. Students will gain a solid understanding of the geography, chronology and archaeology of the ancient Egyptian culture, which will be contextualised within developments in the wider region of the Near East, as well as an understanding of the key problems and controversial areas of interpretation as a basis for further specialised study in the discipline.",
