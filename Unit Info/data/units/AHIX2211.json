These are the dramatic years of Greek prehistory which the poet Hesiod famously described as the ‘Age of Heroes’, whose legends were recounted in Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. This unit critically examines the rich archaeological evidence, beginning with the emergence of complex societies in the Cyclades and Crete and the creation of the Minoan palace civilization with its most prestigious site of Knossos. Then follows a critical study of the rise of competing states on the Greek mainland including Mycenae, Tiryns, and Pylos. The Linear B script will also be explored for the information it provides concerning the Late Bronze Age Mycenaean society.",
