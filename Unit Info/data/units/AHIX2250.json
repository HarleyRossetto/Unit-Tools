Informed by theory and research paradigms developed in the social and cultural sciences, the unit will identify the processes by which the ancient Egyptian culture was transformed and yet maintained its cultural identity throughout its long history. Topics to be examined include, social organisation, identity and personhood, modes of governance, the social dimensions of ancient Egyptian mortuary practices, the complexity and variability of visual culture and representation, in addition to the use and adaptive re-use of mortuary and cultic landscapes and the reception of ancient Egypt in the memory of the world.",
