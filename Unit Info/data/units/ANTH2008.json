    "description": "This unit introduces students to anthropological approaches of studying religion and to some of the core themes of the anthropology of religion. We will explore multiple religious beliefs, meanings, experiences, expressions and practices across diverse sociocultural environments both in the past and within the contemporary moment. Topics to be examined include religious myths, symbols and rituals; material religion; religion and art practices; shamanism; theocracy; secularism; and interplay between religion and politics. Special attention will be paid to how anthropologists conduct ethnographic fieldwork, the central method for anthropologists, on the religious. Students will gain a sense of the range of challenges and issues that professional anthropologists engage with when doing extended field research on religious worlds and lives. Through studying these topics, students will gain new theoretical knowledge and analytical tools that will enable them to critically examine sociocultural dimensions of religion.",
