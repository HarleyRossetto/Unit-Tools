    "description": "<div>All our social practices have a cultural dimension that is as profound as any material imperative such as earning a livelihood. In the twentieth century anthropologists concerned with the study of culture came to focus on systems of symbols and meaning. In this unit we will ground the study of symbols and meaning in three dimensions of human existence. First, we understand the world around us as specific kinds of meaningful places rather than as a neutral backdrop to meaning. Second, our own bodies and sensory bodily practices are the primary vehicle and means for this capacity to make the world meaningful. Third, we experience ourselves as creatures who inhabit time, but in quite varied and distinctive ways. Throughout, the emphasis will be on how we as students of culture have our own experiences of place, of embodiment, of ritual, of symbol and myth, of death, and of happier experiences such as music and song. We will read broadly from rich ethnographies of other places and people, and we will also create spaces to explore our own experiences as cultural beings through story telling. </div>",
