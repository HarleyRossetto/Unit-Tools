For anthropology, the globalisation thesis raises important questions about culture, religion and about the question of how violence and its control has changed in a global world. How are we to understand cultures, religious movements and ideologies, previously understood as bounded entities? How might we theorise the relationship between local and global events, such as conflicts, terrorism and violence? This course will introduce students to the field of anthropology and its sub-disciplines through the discussion of these questions that anthropologists investigate in contemporary and past societies. Some of the issues explored in this course include; religion and worldview, religion in relation to globalisation, power and inequality, violence and conflict, and the formation of new religious movements. We will look at the &#39;speeding-up&#39; of the world in terms of our experience of time and space, and we will consider the possibility of alternative or parallel modernities.",
