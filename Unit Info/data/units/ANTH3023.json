We begin with theories of what makes &#39;development&#39; take place. We examine different models for helping people in poor countries to show how the complexity of international and national relations at the macro-level and social relations at the micro-level makes this such a difficult process. We then explore specific themes in the contemporary practice of &#39;doing development&#39; such as the changing rhetoric and practices of donor agencies, debt and structural adjustment, China&#39;s increasing impact, poverty alleviation and equity, NGOs and community empowerment, gender and social vulnerability, new social movements and sustainability, migration, resettlement and social justice. Students will come to understand donor-driven development as both a way of thinking and a set of practices that affect recipient populations in profound ways.",
