Through close examination of case studies, students will come to understand donor-driven development as both a way of thinking and a set of practices that affect recipient populations in profound ways. Students will gain insights into how development &#39;works&#39; from two inter-related perspectives: anthropology of development, which examines theoretical approaches to development over the past 50 years, and development anthropology, which engages with contemporary practices within international aid programs. We will look at individual projects run by NGOs and also by the Asian Development Bank as well as related literature to consider what works and what doesn&#39;t. We also discuss the broader context in which development takes place and examine topics such as Australia&#39;s aid policies, poverty alleviation and equity, Chinese models of development assistance, consulting agencies, NGOs and new social movements, sustainable development, gender issues, development-induced displacement, social justice and social impact mitigation.",
