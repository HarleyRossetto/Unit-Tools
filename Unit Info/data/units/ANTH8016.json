    "description": "This unit examines the evolutionary, cultural, socio-economic, and political dimensions of disease and health. Notions of disease causality and healing practices vary across societies, and an understanding of the dynamics of these factors is crucial not only for theoretical advancement, but also for applied intervention in the field of international public health. In addition to surveying the key conceptual developments in medical anthropology, we look at how anthropological perspectives and methods can be used in applied settings. We also explore issues in critical medical anthropology, such as: How do global inequalities and violence affect health in developing countries? What larger social transformations accompany the rise of biomedicine, including recent biomedical technologies? These topics explore various dimensions through which medical anthropology can analyse and shape global health policies and interventions, preparing students to work in health policy and applied research.",
