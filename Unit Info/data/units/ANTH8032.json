To affect change at the individual, community and global levels, we need to appreciate how human biology and health are shaped by the larger contexts in which they are embedded and the dynamic and uneven circulation of resources, technology, culture, values and people. In this unit, we will examine the role of social, political-economic and environmental forces that shape the patterning and the distribution of disease and health across communities and take a critical perspective when examining the underlying value systems in biomedical science, policy, health interventions, and global health practice. This unit offers a framework for understanding the complex ways that health and disease intersect within a range of global contexts, institutions and practices.",
