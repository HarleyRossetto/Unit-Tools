    "description": "Using anthropological and ethnographic studies, this unit focuses mainly on the social and cultural contexts of drug use, both legal and illegal. Topics include: the international traffic in opium/heroin and cocaine in the Golden Triangle of mainland South-East Asia and in South America and the way this traffic inter-meshes with regional politics and local tribal, peasant and commercial systems of production and exchange; the social history of drugs in the USA, UK and Australia; youth culture and drugs in the West; AIDS and intravenous drug use; addiction and treatment; drugs and the law; the global political economy of pharmaceuticals, particularly contraceptives, erectile dysfunction drugs, and antiretrovirals in the age of AIDS; and the placebo effect. Students will learn to appreciate the complex ways that drug use is shaped by cultural, historical, economic, and political factors on a global scale. This unit also examines psychological theories of addiction and the neurology of drug use. All enrolment queries should be directed to Open Universities Australia (OUA): see www.open.edu.au",
