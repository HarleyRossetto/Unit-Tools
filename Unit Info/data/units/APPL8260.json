Emphasising an ecological view of relationships between out-of-class learning and in-class learning, the course will cover the roles of intentional and incidental learning inside and outside the classroom, debates on the need for instruction in SLA, and the implications of research on language learning beyond the classroom for our understanding of the concepts of autonomy, learning strategies and motivation.",
