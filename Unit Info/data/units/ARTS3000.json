Students will engage with a partner organisation from either the university, corporate, government or not-for-profit sector, and contribute to a community outreach, advocacy, consultancy or research project. Students will bring to their activity a sensitivity to, and appreciation of the complexity of the cultural and social world, while making a positive contribution to an organisation and/or community. The activity will be supported by five on-campus workshops and through online modules and discussion forums. Through these, students will be prompted to connect cultural, social and ethical theory to practice, reflect on skill and knowledge development, road-test possible careers and set goals for the future. Please direct queries, including questions about eligibility and application requirements, to the Faculty of Arts PACE staff through arts.pace&#64;mq.edu.au at least four weeks before the beginning of session.",
