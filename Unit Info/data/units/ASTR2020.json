Topics on observational astronomy (e.g. galaxies, stars, exoplanets) are covered alongside data and instrumentation requirements. Hands-on lab and project work provide a foundation in optical and radio telescope design and instrumentation. Python programming for image processing and analysis of large datasets are introduced and developed in the labs and major project. Modern project management tools and best-practice in experimental design are incorporated into the unit.",
