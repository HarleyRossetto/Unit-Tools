    "description": "This unit is for anyone interested in humans, and how humans interact with the rest of the living world. The subjects covered include basic anatomy, genetics, physiology, disease, reproduction, and human evolution. BIOL1210 will give you the ability to think critically about the major problems of our times, which are often biological in nature. To understand issues such as genetic engineering, global climate change, bioterrorism, cloning, assisted reproductive technologies, antibiotic resistance or the emergence of new human diseases requires a familiarity with modern biological knowledge. In particular, it is increasingly important for anyone involved in human health or medicine to understand ecological and evolutionary processes. We aim to equip you with this knowledge, and at the same time give you an appreciation for the mystery and diversity of life on this planet. The unit content is dealt with in such a way that students without prior studies in biology will not be at a disadvantage, however biology students are also encouraged to take this unit. ",
