    "description": "This Unit considers the structure and function of the nervous system. We begin with an overview of the functional organization of the central and peripheral divisions of the nervous system. We discuss how the selective permeability of the cell membrane gives rise to the electrical properties of excitable cells. We look in detail at the generation, propagation and transmission of neural signals, and examine the important principles of sensory physiology such as transduction, adaptation and stimulus coding. Having covered these basic principles, the unit goes on to explore the somatosensory system, and the nerves and organs that give rise to the special senses (vision, hearing, taste and smell) are also discussed. We next examine the structure and physiology of muscle cells, and the central control of motor function. Lastly, we cover the autonomic nervous system and the neuroendocrine system, both of which regulate numerous physiological processes throughout the body.",
