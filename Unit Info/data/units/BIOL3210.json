    "description": "This unit follows on from BIOL2230 and BIOL2220. We will investigate the interaction of the renal and respiratory systems in the control of body pH. The next topic is the control of blood pressure leading to a discussion of hypertension and exercise. We continue with endocrinology discussing signal transduction and messenger pathways, and the role of hormones in the regulation of blood chemistry. A discussion of neuroendocrine systems and function of thyroid, sex, growth, mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones leads into a discussion of stress and the stress hormones. The immune system will be introduced to develop an understanding of immunity and health problems associated with autoimmune responses. As obesity is currently a major threat to human health we will consider energy balance and the neurological basis for homeostatic and hedonic control of appetite before investigating other factors involved in weight control including genetics, foetal programming, protein leverage and the gut microbiota. Guest lectures will showcase important aspects of physiology in a clinical and research perspective. Practical classes will make use of laboratory experiments to measure physiological parameters such as blood pressure during exercise, and acid and base levels in the urine. In these classes students will act both as investigators and experimental subjects.",
