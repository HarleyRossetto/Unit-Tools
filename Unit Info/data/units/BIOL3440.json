The unit provides a holistic catchment perspective, covering lakes, rivers and estuaries communities, fish, invertebrates and ecosystem processes, with a focus on Australian systems. Students will come to understand the key ecological components and processes in aquatic systems, and how ecological knowledge can be applied to management issues. The unit will provide students with experience in environmental monitoring and manipulative experiments, including formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, data collection, analyses, and communication of results. Students will also gain fundamental field-based skills which underpin the monitoring and assessment of aquatic systems. A basic knowledge of statistics is assumed. This unit has a strong emphasis on fieldwork, with essential supporting and contextual knowledge provided by laboratory classes and lectures. This unit helps prepare individuals for employment in aquatic sciences and is beneficial for those continuing to postgraduate studies in aquatic ecology and management.",
