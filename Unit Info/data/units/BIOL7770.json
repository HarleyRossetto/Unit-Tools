It is a multi-institutional unit taught at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS) with contributions from the four University partners of SIMS. Lectures and tutorials will be taught by leading researchers in marine science. Topics cover physical and biological oceanography, climate change, molecular ecology, aquaculture, marine biology and marine geosciences. In practical classes, students will analyse and interpret remote-sensing data from the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), which provides comprehensive information on the biological and physical processes of Australia&#39;s coastal and oceanic waters. This gives students hands-on experience in working with and analysing big data sets. Students can attend lessons either at SIMS or fully online.",
