The problem of measuring biodiversity is considered in detail, including the conceptual and practical impediments to measurement. Current and emerging threats to biodiversity are reviewed on a global scale, along with the practical and ethical arguments for conservation. Tutorials and assessments are focussed on analysing and interpreting patterns in biodiversity in space and time as a means of informing conservation decisions.",
