Departmental Seminars &amp; Discussions This is a forum for visiting scientists to convey topics of interest to the department and an excellent opportunity for Department members to learn about cutting edge research. These seminars will form the basis for the discussion groups, as well as your other assessments. Following each Department seminar, you will meet with the speaker as a group and discuss the topic they presented. These discussions allow researchers to explore the topics they covered in more depth, and for you to benefit from their knowledge and thoughts. Proactive participation in a discussion group subsequent to the departmental seminar is required. External Seminars In addition to the Biology Seminar Series, you will also be required to attend 3 seminars elsewhere (e.g. other departments at Macquarie University, other universities, museums, botanical gardens or other research oriented institutions).",
