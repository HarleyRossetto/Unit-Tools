This practical report should be presented in the style of a scientific publication and describe the procedures and results from the first two practical sessions.  It is recommended that you start drafting your report at the commencement of the first practical session. In these practical sessions you will learn essential skills, including: how to isolate DNA, visualize DNA using gel electrophoresis, perform PCR amplification, and sequence a mitochondrial gene. You will learn to identify unknown DNA samples by comparing their sequences with those available in DNA sequence databases. After this, you will align all the DNA sequences collected and build a phylogenetic tree as a complementary method for species identification. Your report will include the activities undertaken within Practicals 1 and 2 within a scientific paper format, with Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion.",
