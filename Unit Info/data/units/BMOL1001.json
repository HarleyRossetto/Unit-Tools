    "description": "This unit is an intensive blended unit which provides students with an understanding of fundamental concepts and principles in chemistry and biochemistry in a clinical context. The unit commences with Module 1 &#34;Biomolecules&#34;. The focus of this first module is on the structure and reactivity of the four major groups of biomolecules (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates). Discussion of each of these five groups allows for the integration of topics from the three traditional areas of general chemistry, introductory organic chemistry and biochemistry. The second module &#34;Metabolism&#34; draws on the concepts presented in the &#34;Biomolecules&#34; module and re-integrates them to fully develop the concepts of biomolecules as energy yielding compounds. Discussion in this second module is focused on metabolic considerations of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, and leads to discussion of topics such as obesity, dieting, fitness and disease. Through the participation in an integrated series of hands-on &#39;Molecules&#39; workshops, students will work with biochemically active &#39;real-life&#39; biomolecules of clinical importance and build a portfolio of biochemical properties of several biomolecules throughout the unit.",
