This unit provides students with the basic knowledge of cellular structure, cell communications and the biochemical reactions which drive growth and development of cells in a variety of contexts. The unit will introduce key biochemical concepts such as enzyme catalysis, compartmentation, metabolic regulation and the flow of energy within cells in the context of intermediary metabolism. The laboratory component of the unit emphasizes the interpretation of quantitative data and the experimental basis for our current ideas and developments in cell biology and biochemistry. Laboratory practical sessions will alternate with tutorials covering lecture and practical topics.",
