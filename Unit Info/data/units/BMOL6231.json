Advances in these fields are dependent on an advanced understanding of the molecular basis of diverse cellular processes. This unit links important biochemical processes to functions and properties of eukaryotic cells. We explore advanced concepts including: enzyme function, properties of membranes, signal transduction, protein trafficking and transport, and protein turnover. These are linked to whole cell behaviours such as cell division and differentiation, programmed cell death, and general responses to external stimuli. Practical work complements lecture material and provides experience with a broad range of current techniques used in research and industry. Laboratory techniques used include analysis of signalling cascades, enzyme kinetics, spectrophotometry, and fluorescence and light microscopy.",
