It will introduce chemical and physical properties of solids, liquids and gases, metals and solutions. It will examine specific reactions including precipitation, acid base chemistry and oxidation/reduction processes and will explore the energetics and rates of chemical change. It will also describe methods of detection and analysis of matter. Specific biological, environmental and new materials related to real world examples will be provided, with topics such as global warming, energy production and renewable fuels. This unit will provide an understanding and appreciation of the role of chemical and biomolecular sciences in our lives, now and in the future, including in helping to achieve a sustainable environment, understanding health and disease, and advancing new molecular technologies.
