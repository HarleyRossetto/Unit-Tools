In this case, the student should consult with the lecturer-in-charge for options. Otherwise, a fail mark may result from this hurdle and ultimately a fail mark for the unit.\n\nDetails on what is expected for assessment of the practical component, including penalties for late submissions, are provided in the laboratory manual/notes (see the iLearn website).

It will be valuable to anyone with an interest in how organic and inorganic compounds react with one another, and how chemists use this knowledge of molecular interactions to synthesise new compounds with desirable properties (eg, new pharmaceuticals, new catalysts, and new materials). The unit focuses on the principles, mechanisms and synthetic procedures of organic and inorganic compounds. Topics include: chemical reactivity; stereochemistry; introduction to the spectroscopic identification of compounds; reaction mechanisms; and synthetic methods. The study of these mechanisms and methods provides an understanding of chemical processes and reactivity applicable in designed and living systems. The practical component is aimed at developing laboratory skills and deductive reasoning; it comprises syntheses of various classes of compounds and identification of unknown compounds by chemical and spectroscopic means.",
