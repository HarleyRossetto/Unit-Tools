It will be valuable to anyone with an interest in how organic and inorganic compounds react with one another, and how chemists use this knowledge of molecular interactions to synthesize new compounds with desirable properties (eg, new pharmaceuticals, new catalysts, and new materials). The unit focuses on the principles, mechanisms and synthetic procedures of organic and inorganic compounds. Topics include: chemical reactivity; stereochemistry; introduction to the spectroscopic identification of compounds; reaction mechanisms; and synthetic methods. The study of these mechanisms and methods provides an understanding of chemical processes and reactivity applicable in designed and living systems. The practical component is aimed at developing laboratory skills and deductive reasoning; it comprises syntheses of various classes of compounds and identification of unknown compounds by chemical and spectroscopic means.",
