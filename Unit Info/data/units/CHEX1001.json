It will commence with the language of chemistry by introducing atoms and molecules and elements and compounds and using representative inorganic and organic compounds, including biomolecules, to show how their structures, functions and reactions are described. It will build on this language to allow prediction of the reactivity, behaviour and function of different classes of compounds, with a focus on acids and bases and organic compounds including biomolecules. Contemporary applications will be highlighted to show the role of chemical and biomolecular sciences in our lives, now and in the future, including in helping to achieve a sustainable environment, understanding health and disease, and advancing new molecular technologies.
