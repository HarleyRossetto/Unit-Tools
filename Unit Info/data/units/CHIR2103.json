Clinical application of biomechanical concepts will relate to the skills of patient observation, joint range of motion assessment, tissue palpation, and muscle testing. Clinical reasoning will begin whereby students will learn to reconcile pathomechanics with clinical findings for musculoskeletal injuries. Applying theories taught in HLTH2110, the clinical concept of epidemiological risk will be introduced and explored. Psychomotor skills taught in CHIR1101 and CHIR1102 will be developed. Chiropractic techniques and joint manipulation skills for the lumbar spine and lower extremity will be introduced.",
