    "description": "In this unit, students will be introduced to different aspects of mechanics of solids and structural analysis of trusses, beams and frames. This provides the students with the skills to analyse structures as a foundation skill to different structural designs. Students will develop their understanding of the physical performance of solid structural members, which are associated with a variety of structural systems in Civil Engineering. They also gain an understanding of the theory and application of structural analysis as it applies to trusses, beams and frames. Specific topics include basic concept of deformation compatibility; stresses and strains in structural elements, states of stress such as shear, bending, and torsion, displacements and deformations, energy methods for bar and beam structures; simple buckling; deformation of simple frames and cell box beams, response of linear elastic structures under different mechanical and environmental effects, and structural behaviour considering the distribution of internal forces.   ",
