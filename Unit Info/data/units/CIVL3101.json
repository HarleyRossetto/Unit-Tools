This unit requires the fundamental knowledge gained through successful completion of Fluid Mechanics in the second year. Specific topics in open channel hydraulics include uniform flow, gradually varied flow, changes in channel cross section, hydraulic structures, and rapidly varied flow. Specific topics in hydrology include fundamentals of hydrology and water resources, Hydrologic cycle, hyetograph and hydrograph analysis, rainfall-runoff relationships and flood routing, hydrologic statistics, and flood frequency analysis.",
