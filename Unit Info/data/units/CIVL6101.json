Theory and conceptual design of systems for treating drinking water and municipal wastewater are discussed. Specific topics in water engineering include introduction to water resources, pollution in different types of water bodies, different water treatment processes, design and implementation, and drinking water regulations. Specific topics in wastewater engineering include introduction to wastewater treatment and process analysis, wastewater characteristics, wastewater flowrates and constituent loadings, physical, chemical, biological unit processes, disinfection, and wastewater treatment process selection, design and implementation. As a part of this unit, students will complete various design tasks in team projects for developing engineering solutions in designing water and wastewater treatment facilities.",
