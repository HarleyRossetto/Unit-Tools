Is it in our actions, in our social world, and in our valued objects and places? Or is it now all online? This unit introduces the interdisciplinary study of memory, offering students a critical survey of memory research across the cognitive and brain sciences, the social sciences, and the arts. Emphasis will be placed on autobiographical memory, embodied memory, and shared remembering between individuals. Students will learn to assess scientific and popular claims about what memory is, and how memory loss and gain can be understood in the digital age.",
