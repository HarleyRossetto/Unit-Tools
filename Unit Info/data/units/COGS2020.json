Students will gain first-hand experience applying these skills by analysing real-life behavioural and neural data sets such as those from fMRI, MEG, and EEG. Students will learn the R programming language, which is widely used throughout the statistics and data science communities in academia and private industry. Topics covered include programming statistical analyses and visualising data in R, effective experimental design for hypothesis testing, and critically examining the results of statistical analyses in the cognitive and brain sciences.",
