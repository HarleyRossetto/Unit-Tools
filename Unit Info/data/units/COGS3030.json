Since the emergence of cognitive neuroscience as a field several decades ago, an impressive range of methods have been developed to investigate the structure and function of the human brain. In this unit, students will learn key principles of a range of functional neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The unit focuses on conceptual and methodological issues surrounding these techniques, giving students the opportunity to think critically about the advantages and disadvantages of each technique for addressing research questions in the field of cognitive neuroscience. The unit will also cover clinical applications of neuroimaging such as its use for investigating autism and schizophrenia.",
