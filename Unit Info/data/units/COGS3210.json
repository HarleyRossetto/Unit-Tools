    "description": "Is the mind in the head? Or might cognitive processes sometimes involve the rest of the body, as well as the brain? This unit examines increasingly popular ideas about ‘embodied cognition’, with a focus throughout on the practical, applied, and empirical significance of these ideas for specific active research programs in the cognitive sciences. Among a range of topics, we look especially at the cognitive mechanisms of action and skilled movement, with examples from the study of sport, performance, and other real-world practices. We introduce methods for studying the rich ecologies of embodied cognition, and encourage students to draw on their own expertise, skills, and interests. This unit provides a thorough, cutting-edge, practical introduction to embodied cognition, and thus to some of the liveliest debates and movements in contemporary cognitive science.",
