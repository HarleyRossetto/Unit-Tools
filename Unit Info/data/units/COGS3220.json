    "description": "This unit is one of the Advanced Topics in Cognitive Science units. This unit provides an overview of the fundamentals and latest research developments, challenges and opportunities of social robotics, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence, with a strong focus on the use of psychological and neuroscientific techniques. In particular, research discussed in this unit describes how these types of technology can be used as tools for advancing our understanding of human neurocognitive function. Topics include but are not limited to an introduction to artificial intelligence, history of social robotics, psychological methods for examining human-technology interaction, neuroscientific methods for examining human-technology interaction, developmental robotics, cross-cultural issues related to human-technology interactions, and the future of human-technology interactions. Tutorials will focus on reading and discussing 2 popular press books (one fiction, one non-fiction) concerning humans’ relationship with technology, and will also feature students presenting an overview of the research they plan to propose in the final research proposal (the focus of the final exam assignment) and receive peer feedback and discussion on these ideas.",
