    "description": "This unit addresses the conceptual foundations of cognitive science. By covering key questions and issues in the philosophy of science, it addresses the underlying assumptions and implications of science. The unit also covers selected topics in cognitive science from a historical and theoretical perspective. The unit gives the students an overview of the major issues and allows them then to reinforce their knowledge with further discussion and reading. The unit is student-led, involving regular critical evaluation of core material, presentations and analyses of mainstream views, and ongoing discussion. This helps to reinforce the students&#39; learning and allows them to decide on the most pertinent issues to their particular discipline and research area with support and direction from the coordinators.",
