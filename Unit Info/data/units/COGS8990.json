Training will be conducted in small group sessions, delivered on-line or in 1-to-1 instruction, followed by practice initially under direct supervision by the supervisor and/or their delegate/s. In addition, you are expected to attend Faculty level, Departmental, and discipline seminars/meetings, which are applicable to your area of research. A log with accompanying brief commentary for each presentation should be maintained throughout the year. It is anticipated that attendance will be at about 80% of faculty and departmental seminars.
