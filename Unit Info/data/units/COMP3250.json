    "description": "This unit gives an understanding of advanced topics in the design and implementation of computer networks. It provides an in-depth understanding of key protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite, and its relationship to emerging technologies. This unit allows students to develop knowledge and expertise in key areas such as intra- and inter-domain routing protocols, multicast protocols, different transport protocols, Quality of Service, and multimedia. These concepts are reinforced through tutorials and laboratory sessions. Knowledge gained during the unit builds upon communication protocols; topological designs; wide area and local area networks; wireless/mobile networks; as well as practical hands-on skills on Cisco equipment. It allows students to expand their skill set by exposure to socket programming paradigm enabling them to better understand the design and implementation of protocols. Some of the reasoning tasks that the students complete require focused thinking instead of iteratively modifying and testing a program. It also enhances students&#39; skills in critical thinking and problem solving using challenging assignments.",
