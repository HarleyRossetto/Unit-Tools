    "description": "This unit provides an introduction to modern cryptography and information security. First, some cryptographic primitives, such as private key and public key ciphers, hash functions and digital signatures, are introduced. Then, some security technologies are discussed to illustrate how basic cryptographic primitives are concretely used in real life applications. Various attacks on the cryptographic schemes and protocols are also discussed.",
