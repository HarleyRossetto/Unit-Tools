Thus it is both a technical document, and a personal journal.  The personal reflections are very important.\n\n",

Assessment of each student will be openly discussed with frequent feedback in a small class environment (and with each student&#39;s agreement).\n\nThis mode of learning is so important for the unit, and requires so much work by the students, that it has initially been given a substantial weighting in the assessment.\n\nNevertheless, as part of the active involvement of students the weightings are subject to negotiated change.",
