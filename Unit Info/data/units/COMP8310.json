The QA session will be conducted by the panel (which includes convener and/or other staff members and/or PhD students within the computing department). The presentation and QA session will help the panel to evaluate the individual contribution of each student. The Project will account to 30% (Report-10%, Presentation-10% and QA-10%) of the unit marks.",
