The unit covers the major aspects of children&#39;s cognitive, physical and social/emotional development, personality, gender and moral development. The unit also considers the influence of key relationships with siblings and peers for children&#39;s development. An understanding of factors that promote and attenuate optimal development and well-being and the unique contribution of child rearing contexts is integrated throughout. In addition, students develop knowledge of strategies for the promotion of good mental health for young children. During the course of the unit, students are encouraged to engage in active interpretation of the material covered and to consider both the implications and practical application in their professional contexts. Particular attention is paid to the implications for prior to school and primary school educators within the contemporary Australian social/cultural context.",
