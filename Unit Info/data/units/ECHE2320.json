Students are required to identify the mathematical concepts and processes in each book. They must then plan a sequence of two or three experiences for each book. This should include reference to diverse learners/ culture or background. Also must link with the EYLF and may link with ES1 in the school curriculum Students should demonstrate knowledge of mathematical concepts and processes. They should also show that they can identify these in storybooks, and then extend on storytelling experience to create follow on experiences.",
