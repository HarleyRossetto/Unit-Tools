    "description": "In this unit notions of &#39;difference&#39; and &#39;disability&#39; are explored in the context of the provision of inclusive early years education and care. Pre-service teachers integrate their growing pedagogical knowledge into a framework focusing on the education of diverse groups of young children. A primary emphasis is on working with children who experience disability and their families. During the unit, pre-service teachers learn about inclusive education and features of inclusive environments and communities, consider theoretical models of disability, explore processes of labeling, acquire understanding of appropriate terminology and language, and develop their knowledge of practical approaches to education. Emphasis is placed on family centered practice, inter-professional collaboration, and planning and assessment processes. Pre-service teachers are supported in developing understanding of sensory development and maximising social interaction and learning, multiple approaches to communication and quality provision of social inclusion. The roles of early years professionals in understanding and responding to challenging behavior, and planning for extension and enrichment in the early years is examined. The implications of theory and practice for engagement in critically reflective practice, with a view to moving beyond rhetoric towards genuinely inclusive education, are considered.",
