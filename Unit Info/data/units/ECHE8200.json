Drawing on a variety of resources, including diverse media, academic publications and reflections on personal experiences, we will explore changing family lives and the extent to which traditional, largely Western-based, images of &#39;family&#39; life reflect contemporary experiences and practices of families and children in Australia and abroad.",
