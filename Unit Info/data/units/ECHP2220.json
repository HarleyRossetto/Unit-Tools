They are assisted to develop observations and begin to think about implications for planning. Students are also taught skills in basic planning and ways to record thoughtful, reflective observations that connect to planning. A range of strategies that provide guidance on ways to support young children&#39;s learning is central to the unit. This includes examining teaching strategies that support ways of working with children from birth to five years. Students engage in active, careful and critical reflection as part of their commitment to teaching whilst considering the Early Years Learning Framework. Students practice these skills as they complete 20 days of teaching experience in prior to school early childhood settings.",
