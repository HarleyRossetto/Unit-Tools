The 20-day practical experience component is based on a sound understanding that students will be operating at a level reasonably expected of a postgraduate student teacher undertaking a block of professional experience as a teacher of young children for the first time. Unit content will focus on examining and reflecting on the student&#39;s role in teaching and learning with young children from birth to two years. \n\nAll enrolment queries should be directed to Open Universities Australia (OUA): see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.open.edu.au\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">www.open.edu.au</a>",
