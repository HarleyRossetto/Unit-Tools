It aims to provide a thorough understanding of what determines the ability of firms and economies to create jobs and remunerate their workers. The unit will address issues of wage stagnation, wage inequality and unemployment, as well as issues such as training, wage growth and returns to skills. By answering these questions, you will be equipped to understand the dynamics of inequality both in Australia as well as globally. Importantly, policy can do a great deal to ameliorate workers’ opportunities in the labour markets and to satisfy business needs for workers, skills and expertise. The unit will focus on the most important policies and their effectiveness in boosting labour market opportunities and reducing inequality.",
