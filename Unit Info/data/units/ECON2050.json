Although the workings of the Australian financial system are explored, the unit has a very global focus. Topics may include: the meaning and nature of money; interest rate determination and the yield curve; central banking and the actions of monetary authorities; the innovations of behavioural finance and crypto-currencies; in-depth analyses of money markets, bond markets, equity markets, and derivatives markets. All these topics are examined both in terms of theoretical foundations and in contemporary practical applications. The central theme of the unit is that innovation in money and finance has been as important as innovation anywhere else in shaping the modern world.",
