    "description": "Australia spends around 10% of its GDP on health - a figure not uncommon among most developed countries. With people living longer, the health care industry is projected to be one of the largest employers, world wide, by 2020. These facts make an understanding of the economics of health care important for future economists. Questions explored include: What makes health a unique economic good? Why does health need government intervention? Why do people buy health insurance? Why do doctors charge richer patients more than poorer patients? What do hospitals maximise: profits; patients treated or quality of service? Adopting a microeconomic approach, students are introduced to concepts and techniques relevant to the understanding of health economics and to answering these questions. Topics may include: the economics of health care (demand and supply, market imperfections including market failure and resulting resource allocation); the behaviour of agents (hospitals, physicians and private health insurers) in health care; the role of government and the need for government intervention; equity and ethics in health care resource allocation; the Australian health care system; health and economic development; the case of Aboriginal health.",
