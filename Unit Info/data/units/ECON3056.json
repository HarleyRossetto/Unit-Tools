    "description": "Why is economics the way it is? Are modern approaches to analysis related to past contributions? Has there been progress in economics, and how would we know? What is the place of the history of economic thought in the history of ideas more generally? The answer to these and many other fascinating questions form the focus of this unit. The unit considers history of economic thought from a non-standard and enlightening perspective. Rather than trace through the chronology of authors and schools of thought, the unit examines the evolution of theories and theoretical ideas from their origins (sometimes in antiquity), through to their modern forms. This puts the economics you have already learned into context and allows for a greater appreciation of the historical, social and philosophical influences on the development of economic thought. Topics may include: theories of value; theories of distribution; theories of growth; theories of cycles and fluctuations.",
