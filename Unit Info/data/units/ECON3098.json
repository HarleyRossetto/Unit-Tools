    "description": "This unit focuses on the three major economies of the Asian region: Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the People’s Republic of China. It covers their distinctive contemporary business and economic institutions, such as sogo shosha and chaebol, and those of the recent past including zaibatsu and Chinese TVEs. The unit goes beyond description, to provide theory to explain why such institutions exist, often uniquely to the region. It approaches the major economies of East Asia as an exercise in applied economic theory, and as an introduction to basic models in development economics. It further draws on economic models to explain how these economies achieved rapid ‘Miracle’ economic growth, and raised per capita incomes from the lowest to amongst the highest in the world. Some of the economic theory will be familiar to students, some of it encountered for the first time, but in either case it will be taught from first principles with no assumed knowledge.",
