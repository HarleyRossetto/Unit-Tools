The unit introduces students to the analysis of the ways in which individuals, businesses and governments behave in contemporary economic settings. Examples of topics covered are consumer behaviour, the behaviour of the firm, its production and cost structure, competition and market structures, monopoly, labour and capital markets, strategic interaction, social outcomes and welfare analysis. These analytical tools are meant to allow students to better understand contemporary global issues. The theory is taught in an applied context. Any basic economic models and accompanying mathematical and other skills required by the unit&#39;s material are taught as part of the unit curriculum.",
