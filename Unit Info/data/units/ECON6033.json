    "description": "This unit is designed to provide the postgraduate student with a deeper understanding of how the economy as an aggregate works. In so doing it allows students to understand economic policy and apply it to the specific context of their interest. The unit covers a wide range of models in use to investigate economic issues today. It will discuss how unemployment and underemployment, employment opportunities, business profits and investment returns, and how policy can impact on these socially relevant outcomes. By openly discussing ways governments can use policy to influence key economic areas, including productivity, national output, unemployment, inflation and household debt, students will have the opportunity to critically explore successful and unsuccessful policies, and gain a perspective on important contemporary policy debates.",
