    "description": "This online unit aims to familiarise students with the myriad forms of communication, on- and off-line, so that they become critical receivers and effective producers, for any media they are working in.  It cultivates awareness of the language of public, social and private communication, and raises questions about the thresholds of publishing in the twenty-first century.  It examines the interplay between verbal communication and other visual, graphic and physical elements in specific contexts, such as exhibitions and in subtitling.  Some assignments are collaborative.  All are designed to develop individual skills in communication, to prepare for further training in professional editing in the Graduate Certificate in Editing and Electronic Publishing, and to substitute for the one-year&#39;s previous experience of editing which has hitherto been required.",
