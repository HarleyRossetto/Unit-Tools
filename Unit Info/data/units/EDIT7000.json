    "description": "This unit is designed to help MRES candidates become effective editors of their own research, and able to project their work in different vehicles of publication. It examines critical aspects of publishing research as (i) a full dissertation, or (ii) a series of papers/journal articles. It compares issues in editing research for publication in print and online as well as broadcasting, to demonstrate the demands of each medium. The scope of the abstract for journal articles, conference papers and prefacing the dissertation is discussed, and the repurposing of content and stylistic adaption needed to publish research as extended non-fiction. Students are introduced to the standard style guides in the humanities, social sciences and sciences, and are given opportunity to discuss more specialised ones within their disciplinary/Faculty groups, with assignments on implementing their different recommendations. The unit provides supplementary (non-assessable) language support online for international students.",
