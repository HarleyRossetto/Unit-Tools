Concepts and perspectives drawn from sociology and history, and also from philosophy, cultural studies, politics and economics, will support your reflections on your own schooling, your direct observations on contemporary practices in education, and in discerning the implications they hold for your future development as a teacher. The concept of &#34;the curriculum&#34; and its many dimensions are explored as an important unifying theme throughout the unit as we investigate how teachers and school leaders seek to be responsive to students, colleagues, parents and communities in the context of the society schools serve. A wide range of contemporary issues are considered relating to families, gender, equity, indigeneity, media, technology and community. Key moments in the history of Australian education are also identified.",
