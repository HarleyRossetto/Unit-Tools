There is a focus on the development of key competencies in understanding the policy, principles and teacher role in inclusive education; understanding diverse learners; establishing an inclusive classroom environment; and, designing inclusive curriculum and teaching practices. Emphasis is placed on strategies that equip teacher education students to work with all students in inclusive classroom environments within early childhood, primary, and secondary settings. Focus will also be on applying differentiation within an inclusive classroom environment and being able to organise and manage a diverse inclusive classroom. The teacher education students reflect upon these skills as they complete 10 compulsory days of professional experience in a primary or secondary school setting.",
