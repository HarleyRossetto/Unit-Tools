Central to the unit is the exploration of a variety of theories on how children learn. Students are assisted to record thoughtful, reflective observations, to use intentional teaching strategies to plan an appropriate curriculum and to follow the planning cycle. Additionally, a range of teaching strategies for guiding children&#39;s learning and behaviour are considered. Students also engage in critical reflection as part of their commitment to teaching through consideration of the Early Years Learning Framework and the National Quality Standards. Students will utilise their coursework knowledge to complete a compulsory professional experience in a prior to school early childhood setting with children aged two to five years.",
