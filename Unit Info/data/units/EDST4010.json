It is particularly concerned with issues related to the use of technology in the classroom: how to successfully select and apply learning technologies to achieve syllabus outcomes; how to interact with social networking platforms in the classroom; how to develop cyber safety habits in secondary school students; and appropriate pedagogies for online learning. Practical application of these understandings is developed through skills-based workshops that focus on the creation, trial and evaluation of a teaching and learning website.",
