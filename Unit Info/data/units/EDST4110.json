Teacher education students will develop understanding of contemporary theory, concepts and skills associated with the study of STEM integration, its practices and associated pedagogies. The unit will focus on critically evaluating a range of STEM pedagogical approaches and learning resources to develop students&#39; STEM capabilities. The unit uses authentic STEM topics to deconstruct and emphasise key principles surrounding STEM based learning, including the pedagogies that support STEM learning, how research can inform STEM teaching, critical evaluation of STEM modules and resources, and the importance of clear curriculum links.",
