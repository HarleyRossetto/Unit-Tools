        "description": "Part A – Group performance\nIn small groups you will prepare an original piece appropriate for performance by children in either Stage 1, 2 or 3. Your topic area should come from a Key Learning Area other than the Creative Arts, eg, History, Science, PDHPE. Using a playbuilding structure, you will incorporate Drama, Music and Dance into a 5 minute performance that addresses content from your chosen topic. Multimedia technology can also be included. You will need to refer to both the NSW Creative Arts Syllabus and the curriculum/syllabus documents of your Key Learning Area.\nThe performance should contain the following elements:\n•\tSinging\n•\tMovement/Dance sequence that incorporates organised sound/music\n•\tClearly defined characters (as evidenced through voice and body movements)\n•\tSequences that incorporate some dramatic techniques eg. use of tableaux, thought tracking, synchronised movement, soundscapes\n•\tEvidence of some of the elements of drama eg. tension, mood, focus\n•\tEvidence of some of the elements of music eg, melody, beat, tempo\n•\tEvidence of some of the elements of dance eg. body, action, space\n•\tA clear beginning and a strong conclusion\n•\tUse of simple costumes and/or props\n\nPart B - Reflection\nFor Part B of this assessment Item, students are required to write a report reflecting on another group’s performance overall, with a focus on: \nIdentifying the forms, conventions and elements of each art form (as appropriate) and the effectiveness of the performance.  \n\nDiscussing the use of the arts to develop learning on the selected topic.\n\nStudents are also required to develop a short peer feedback for use by children for the same performance. Depending on the children’s literacy levels, the template may provide sentence starters or a more open-ended approach involving writing, drawing and/or other forms of visual representation. The template should provide opportunities for the children to reflect on:\nWhat the performance was about: information/messages gleaned about the topic\nThe elements of dram (2500 wds)",

        "description": "Planning for Authentic Integrated Arts Learning : Programming sequential integrated learning experiences\nFor this assessment item, students are to provide a summary of a sequence of 4 sequential learning experiences in the Visual Arts (drawing, painting, collage, printmaking, photography, site-specific installations etc). These learning experiences should be also integrated with at least one other art-form from the Creative Arts (Dance, Drama, Music) for either Early Stage 1 or Stage 1 of the Australian Curriculum Creative Arts Syllabus. \nThey need to consider the context of the children they are planning for (this can be a hypothetical context, or a context they are familiar with), and provide a rationale for why these experiences have the potential to foster meaningful art-making/performing and deep learning in the arts for this particular group of children, including a range of teaching strategies.\nStudents should focus on introducing children to the work of a well-known artist as way of exploring techniques and the elements of visual arts such as colour, line, shape, pattern and form.  Students will also consider appropriate art materials and media to use in the classroom. \nThis assessment has a specific focus on integrating learning in the Visual Arts with another art-form (Music, Dance, and Drama). The learning experiences should also provide explicit links to one or more of the K-6 Key Learning Areas. The final paper should include:\na brief introduction to the children and their context \nbackground information on chosen artist and his/her work including notable techniques and elements that will form the focus of the teaching\nbrief rationale for the particular focus of teaching chosen for the learning experiences, and for learning in and through the arts in general\na summary of the 4 sequential learning experiences including links to syllabus outcomes from the Australian Curriculum Creative Arts Syllabus\nlinks to one or more KLAs, other than Creative Arts\n (2500 wds)",
