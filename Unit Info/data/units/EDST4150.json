This unit focuses on developing knowledge of literature and how teachers can use literature in designing learning experiences that build multimodal and critical literacy skills in primary school children, the skills required to communicate effectively through language, images and other modes and understand their role in creating and maintaining or subverting social values in today&#39;s linguistically and culturally diverse world. Through examination of a range of literary forms/genres, traditions and media (nursery rhymes and poetry, picture books, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island literature, non-fiction, multicultural literature, adaptations of children&#39;s literature in film and interactive multimedia), this unit considers the potential of literature to support the teaching of all three strands of English in the Australian National Curriculum: language, literacy and literature.",
