An introductory research module will be completed to develop skills in practitioner inquiry and using evidence in teaching practice. Learning experiences will also build knowledge and understanding about: theories and practices in classroom management; how to create supportive and safe learning environments; the role of parents/carers in education supportive and safe learning environment. Initial teacher education students will develop skills in reflexivity and initiate professional connections with teachers in a range of educational settings.",
