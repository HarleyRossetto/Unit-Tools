It is the third in a three unit sequence designed to establish a knowledge base for Teacher Education Students to teach STEM using an integrated approach in the primary classroom. The unit uses authentic STEM topics to deconstruct and emphasise key principles surrounding STEM based learning, including the pedagogies that support STEM learning, how research can inform STEM teaching, critical evaluation of STEM modules and resources, and the importance of clear curriculum links. The unit will focus on critically evaluating a range of STEM pedagogical approaches and learning resources to develop students&#39; STEM capabilities.",
