It includes the first Professional Experience placement for the course. Learning will include a focus on language development, language and literacy in Australian curriculum and other policy documents and quality research-informed teaching strategies. The unit offers a systematic, research-based introduction to foundational knowledge of language and literacies and provides opportunities to develop knowledge of the language system and its uses, purposes, and practices in reading and writing for a range of audiences and purposes and in a range of mediums including visual and multi-modal forms. Learning and teaching will develop understanding of the integration of technology, the role of quality texts in supporting literacy learning and how to nurture creativity and engagement in English during the primary years. Students will also complete a professional experience placement where they work with a Supervising Teacher and gain experience in curriculum, pedagogy, and classroom management in a school environment. During this professional experience placement, students will engage in reflexive practices to evaluate and critique their experiences and knowledge and gain experience in evidence--based teaching practice.",
