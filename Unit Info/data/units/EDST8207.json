It emphasises the need for a continuous cycle of explicit, systematic, and evidence-based teaching practice to support learning outcomes of all students. Students will explore and evaluate strategies for supporting learning to read and writing using a range of quality non-fiction and literary texts and in ways that consider children&#39;s oral language development and diverse linguistic and cultural experiences and nurture confidence and creativity.",
