It extends students&#39; understanding of teaching principles and strategies for promoting the language and literacy skills of diverse learners across the later primary school years.  The focus of the unit is on reading to learn and composing effective written and multimodal texts for a range of purposes and audiences. The unit will also examine research-informed ways teachers can use oral language interactions and a range of quality everyday and literary texts in their classrooms. The pedagogic emphasis is on a continuous cycle of explicit, systematic, and evidence-based instruction for all students. Collegial, co-operative relationships underpin work in this unit and there is an emphasis on the autonomous learning and reflective capacity needed for continued development as a teacher of English in primary schools.",
