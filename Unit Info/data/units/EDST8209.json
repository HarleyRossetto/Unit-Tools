Students will investigate current specialist pedagogies as a basis for developing personal approaches to the provision of early childhood arts education. Lectures and workshops will guide students through theoretical and practical approaches to arts pedagogies in dance, drama, music, and visual arts, developing appropriate teaching and assessment strategies. Students will examine approaches to integrating The Arts across other key learning areas. This unit focuses on the pivotal role of The Arts in the lives of children. Students are provided with opportunities to enhance their capacity to use diverse resources that underpin high quality arts education. The unit provides a forum through which to critique contemporary issues in arts education, drawing on current research in education and allied fields. Students will also explore the role of community and professional arts organisations, such as museums, galleries, and performing arts companies, in providing opportunities for children to gain experience and appreciation of the art forms.",
