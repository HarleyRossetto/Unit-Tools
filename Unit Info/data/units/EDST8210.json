The content covered in this unit covers four broad fields of inquiry. First, we explore how intervention research is conducted in health and education settings. We also learn to interpret and action the finding of meta-analytic studies in these fields. Second, we critique interpretations of Quality Health and Physical Education followed by learning how to assess it. Third, we compare and contrast ways in which we can teach personal, social and community health to children. Finally, we critique the pedagogies associated with teaching meaningful movement and physical activity in school-based settings. This overall goal for students is for them to construct strategies that allow for the design and delivery of authentic learning experiences in the HPE context. It also incorporates exploration of strategies in differentiating learning of HPE within an inclusive classroom and applying independent research knowledge to improve teaching practices.",
