An assessment digital portfolio or website will be produced containing background research setting the context for the problem (etc.) for example - the history, rationale, background etc.;  a brief plan of action (what is the plan to solve the problem?); a summary of materials or resources used (physical, informational, personnel etc); evidence of implementation, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the process used and resulting outcome. The assessment digital portfolio or website must utilise different media (e.g., short video clips, images, concept maps) and be made easily accessible for marking purposes. The content of the digital portfolio or website must be concise, well organised under each of the above sections, and contain a brief (500 word) reflective statement summarising personal learning from this task in relation to the rationale, goals and purpose of STEM education, as investigated in Assignment 1. A separate reflective statement is required for each group member.",
