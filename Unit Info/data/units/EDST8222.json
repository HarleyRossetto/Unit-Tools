It draws attention to the central role of language in shaping understandings of self and the world. Emphasis is placed on the responsive classroom skills and knowledge required for effective teaching in classrooms with diverse student needs and on the theoretical perspectives and research that underpin syllabus documents. A range of research-informed pedagogical approaches are explored, evaluated and implemented. Course content includes: the history of English teaching, the contextual factors impacting on language use, adolescent literature, the significance of creativity, the pedagogical integration of technology and the processes leading to responding to and composing texts for a range of audiences and purposes and in a range of mediums including visual and multi-modal forms. Skills in independent learning and research will be fostered and students given opportunities to explore areas of interest and to interrogate contested aspects of the teaching of English.",
