The course aims to develop research capacity, critical and independent thought with student-centred learning strategies modelled, practiced and discussed. The need to implement collaborative, cooperative and inclusive education is also demonstrated. The course examines different approaches to programming, lesson planning and forms of assessment. It also develops awareness of the professional role of the teacher.",
