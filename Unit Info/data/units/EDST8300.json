It begins with an overview and analysis of the broad fields of educational psychology and developmental psychology and recent topical debates are introduced. Topical focus areas include the development of motivation and engagement in students, student interactions with peers and teachers and the pedagogical debates surrounding the application of knowledge emerging from research. Students will conduct an independent study of a problem of practical or theoretical significance by deeply engaging with relevant research and theory from a psychological and developmental viewpoint. Students are encouraged to develop a research-based understanding that may be further developed in future research or study or in their practical workplace context.",
