Teacher education students will be provided with opportunities to develop advanced understandings of key issues related to inclusive and special education in contemporary education contexts. Acknowledging and valuing the full range of human diversity, teacher education students will develop and apply advanced knowledge and skills to providing high quality education to all learners. There is a focus on complex and sometimes conflicting theoretical perspectives. The pervasive influence of social constructions of disability and issues of ableism and disablism will be addressed. Relevant legislation, policy, and practice will be examined. Teacher education students will critically analyse barriers to equity in education for students with disability. A range of research-informed pedagogical approaches will be explored and evaluated. Family perspectives; understanding diverse learners; collaboration; establishing an inclusive classroom environment; and designing inclusive curriculum and teaching practices including engaging with universal design for learning and quality differentiated practices will be considered.",
