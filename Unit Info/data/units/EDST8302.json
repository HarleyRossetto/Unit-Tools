In Part 2 (1000 words), students will determine a specific issue which is identifiable in the data (e.g., poor attendance of students, boys not making benchmarks in reading etc.). Students will then review current empirical research on the factors relating to the chosen issue. In Part 3 (1000 words), students will outline a proposal (a list of recommendations) which are aimed at resolving the chosen issue and improving the outcomes of students. This will include an evaluation plan using the Logic Plan to assess the effectiveness of the plan to improve learning outcomes.",
