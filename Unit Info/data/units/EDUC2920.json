This specialist knowledge and skills that students develop will enhance their capacity to make sound, evidence-based professional judgements, support their future self-directed professional learning, and thereby contribute to the ongoing refinement of their professional practice. The group work component of the unit will scaffold the development of students&#39; abilities to work collaboratively in order to make a meaningful contribution to school-wide improvement efforts.",
