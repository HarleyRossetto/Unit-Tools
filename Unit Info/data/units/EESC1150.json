Immerse yourself in and explore things that happened millions to billions of years ago and are recorded in the vast time capsules of Earth - its rocks. This introductory unit is suitable for all students including those wanting to try a natural science. It explores the composition and structure of our planet and the dynamic processes that change our environment. The unit provides a strong background for further studies in earth and environmental sciences as well as biology, chemistry, physics and archaeology. This unit involves an adventurous day trip across the Blue Mountains and pairs well with ENVS1017 The Living Environment and EESC1160 Blue Planet: Climate, Oceans and Life.",
