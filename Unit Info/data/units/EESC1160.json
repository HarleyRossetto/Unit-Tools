This unit introduces this exceptional environment through study of the oceans past, present and future, with particular focus on the oceans’ ties to climate and life. The unit considers: the history and dynamics of ocean basins; technology for probing the ocean&#39;s depths; physical, biological and chemical oceanographic processes; ocean circulation patterns; waves and tides; shallow water and deep marine depositional environments; marine life; long term global climate change; and human interactions with the marine environment for a sustainable future. Students will be introduced to water and sediment sampling techniques via a marine fieldtrip. This unit pairs well with ENVS1017 The Living Environment and EESC1150 Planet Earth.",
