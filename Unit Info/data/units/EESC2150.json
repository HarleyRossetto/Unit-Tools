    "description": "252 million years ago life on our planet was nearly exterminated: 96% of marine life and over 70% of terrestrial life went extinct. The causes for this mass extinction are still debated. In this unit we explore the geological history of this event. You will visit the site of the extinction boundary on a field trip and develop geological skills to understand the paleoenvironment and Earth processes that were changing at this time. You will interrogate continental reconstructions to uncover why there were glaciers near Sydney in the Permian and delve into the mantle to understand volcanoes, large igneous provinces and their devastating hazards. You will discuss how and why the magnetic field was changing at this time and investigate sediments and geochemistry to understand the link between Earth&#39;s interior and the surface. Through this analysis, we will try to understand one of the biggest questions in Earth Science: what caused the Permo-Triassic mass extinction? You will develop your skills in field work and geological mapping, rock and mineral identification in hand samples and under the microscope, viewing and probing global datasets and continent reconstructions, analysing geochemical data, and synthesising data to address scientific questions. This is a topical elective for those interested in how geoscience informs current and future environmental crises.",
