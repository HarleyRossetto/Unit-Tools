Students can work in groups on the project but submissions are individually. There are two assessments involved. One assessment is a presentation to be given during week 12. it will be done individually during tutorial and laboratory sessions. The other assessment is the project report that summarizes the project works and the associate findings.The individual submissions of the reports will be announced later through iLearn. Each item accounts for half of the weighting of Project. All the project materials are required to be packed in one folder and submitted by the end of week 13. ",
