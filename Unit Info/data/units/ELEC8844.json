The unit builds on from preceding Digital Signal Processing unit and introduces the software defined radio concept along with various software defined radio architectures and platforms. Topics covered include: sampling and quantisation, low-pass representation of bandpass systems, quadrature-signal representation, frequency translation, sample rate conversion, decimation and interpolation, direct and polyphase interpolator and decimator architectures, half-band FIR filters, digital up and down converters, matched filters and the software defined radio architectures and platforms. The unit culminates in a project where students develop a software defined radio technology-based solution from high-level functional specifications through to design, implementation and testing on real hardware.",
