Global research shows that 40% of graduates have their job applications rejected because of poor grammar, while 17% of firms are concerned about graduates’ lack of grammar skills. This unit provides you with the basic grammar skills that you will need for writing well in your assignments and job applications. We will show you how to recognise grammatically incorrect sentences that don’t make sense to your reader, then we will help you fix these. You will learn how to: paragraph for different purposes; structure and tailor your writing for various types of work; and edit and proofread your writing so that your work not only suggests intelligence and capability, but also attention to detail.",
