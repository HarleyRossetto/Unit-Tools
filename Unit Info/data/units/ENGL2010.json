    "description": "This unit explores the rich and ever-changing category of &#39;the human&#39; as it features in some of the most influential writings in English up to and including those by Shakespeare. It considers how these writings responded to and shaped ideas of &#39;the human&#39; in their own times, while also examining how earlier literary representations of humanness relate to our modern assumptions about what it is to be human. Students will be exposed to a range of texts that offer insights into how the mind, the emotions, and the body were understood in medieval and early modern literature, and also study later texts that adapt these early ideas for modern use. The unit offers students an approach to early literature that will acquaint them with distant times and world views while also anchoring their studies of later literatures and shedding light on their understanding of the world today. This unit increases their literary-historical knowledge as well as their conceptual and technical vocabulary, to analyse and discuss literature from different periods and contexts with confidence. It also enables them to develop a sophisticated understanding of how cultures across time intersect with one another, and appreciate the vital function played by literature throughout the human story.",
