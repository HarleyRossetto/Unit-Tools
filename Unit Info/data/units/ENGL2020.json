The novels and poems you will study helped to create new visions of the human, creating and responding to changing worldviews about many facets of social life: political, scientific and artistic. Major figures such as Jane Austen, William Wordsworth, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti and George Eliot will be studied alongside lesser-known innovators such as Charlotte Smith, John Clare and Augusta Webster. The unit will explore how these writers used literature to respond to the most challenging and divisive issues of their time in a way that still speaks to modern readers and created the foundation of the world we live in today.",
