Students will analyse traditional literary texts (novels, poetry, short story) alongside graphic novels, television series, films, and video games, to consider the multitude of ways in which visual forms borrow from the literary imagination. The unit will engage with research and scholarship focused on sequential art, serialised television, film studies, and new media theory, while exploring methods of adaptation and transmedia production. Key theoretical and conceptual issues such as narrative methods in poetry, drama, prose, and visual communication and literacy will be examined, along with the role literary and visual narratives play in the public discourse surrounding politics, gender, ethnicity, and the environment.",
