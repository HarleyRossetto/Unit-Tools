We begin by analysing the form and features of bestselling novels as well as mass-market genre fiction such as fantasy, science-fiction, suspense/thriller/horror, crime, and romance. We examine how generic forms crossover with each other, and how digital publishing enables the proliferation of hybrid genres and niche subgenres within the popular fiction market. Students learn how to identify different types of research fields that are relevant to their genre of interest, and to integrate this research into their creative writing in practical ways. There will be a particular focus on world-building, characterisation, and the development of character-driven plots.",
