    "description": "The limitations of Western conceptions of &#34;the human&#34; are highlighted in this unit as we consider how twenty-first century Australian, Indigenous, American, postcolonial and other forms of literature challenge and expand Western conceptions of humanity, subjectivity and belonging. This unit looks at how literature is alive in the world today, and how it responds to the new challenges and opportunities afforded to it by the twenty-first century. The premise of this unit is that literature plays an active role in the contemporary public sphere, and that writers are developing exciting and innovative ways of responding both to contemporary debates on matters including race, immigration, gender, terrorism and globalisation, and to new contexts for their work, including the Internet, new forms of literary celebrity, and the rise of creative writing programmes. You will be encouraged to see how the essays you write and the literary analysis you perform can help to create links between the so-called &#34;real world&#34; and the texts you read. We will reflect on how we read literature now, and how we can best write about literature to capture its presence and power in our lives.",
