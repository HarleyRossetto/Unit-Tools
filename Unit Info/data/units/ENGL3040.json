It aims to extend students both critically and creatively so that they can read, write, discuss or teach poetry with confidence and better understand its continuing evolution today. Students will study the histories and types of poetic excellence through ancient texts and their present-day equivalents. We will consider how we read, write and teach poetry in ways that borrow from the insights of the past while using the tools of the twenty-first century, such as YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. We will analyse the rise of &#39;Instagram Poets&#39; such as Rupi Kaur to better understand how they reach thousands of followers in a cybernetic reinvention of poetic fame and the transmission of poetry. Students will gain an enhanced understanding of the traditions and techniques of English-language poetry, learn to experiment with poetry and receive supportive feedback from published poets and poetry scholars to improve their creative &#39;eye&#39; and &#39;ear&#39;, as well as their own editing skills.",
