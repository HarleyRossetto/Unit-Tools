This unit will prepare students for research in literary studies by addressing questions concerning how we as scholars approach literary texts and the critical responses they have attracted; how we recognize and assess a literary approach; and what questions and access points we use to understand and critique literary texts. Practically, students will learn to identify, understand, and apply different questions and concepts to the interpretation of texts and to the creation of meaning.",
