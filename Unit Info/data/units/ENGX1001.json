    "description": "English literature is foundational to modern life, providing everyday cultural references and a storehouse of stories that entertain us and enrich our\ncommunication and interaction with each other. This entry unit is informed by the questions: What is literature for? Why is it necessary? Why is it\nuseful? Running through our program is the idea that literature helps us conceive of what it means to be human, and to apprehend the lived experience of other humans.\n\nThis unit surveys English literature from its medieval beginnings, through the Shakespearean Renaissance, to the late nineteenth century, when the\nModernist movement began to supplant the Decadence of the late Victorian era, and children&#39;s literature began to proliferate, contributing to our\nmodern idea of what it means to be a child. Students will read a wide variety of literature and will be introduced to a range of concepts and tools for studying these texts. Along with a chronological knowledge of literary movements, this unit develops skills at university level in critical reading, textual analysis and writing about literary texts. Short literary works and weekly critical studies provide focal points for developing detailed and informed ways of interpreting different kinds of narratives. This unit will also provide students with an introduction to further studies in English and creative writing at Macquarie.",
