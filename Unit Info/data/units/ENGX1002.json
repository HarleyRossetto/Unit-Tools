It analyses how English, Australian and American writers - poets, playwrights, novelists, graphic novelists and screenwriters - responded in profoundly intellectual and visceral ways to the wars, calamities, technological change and digital disruptions of what Eric Hobsbawm calls the &#39;Age of Extremes&#39;. We trace patterns of alienation and anomie, but also the growing urgency of hope and human rights in literary responses to the modern world. Continuing to develop university level skills in critical reading, textual analysis and writing about literary texts, this unit also introduces students to theories of visual literacy and critical studies, equipping students with the tools to interpret different kinds of narratives.",
