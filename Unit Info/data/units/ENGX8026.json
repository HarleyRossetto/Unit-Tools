The two consecutive units Manuscript Project A and Manuscript Project B provide an opportunity for a sustained piece of writing to be developed over two sessions. There are no classes or workshops: students work independently with regular written and verbal feedback from a writing supervisor. It is expected that the final work will be of a potentially publishable standard. Application is open to students who have demonstrated excellent progress in their writing units and have submitted a compelling and potentially publishable project plan.
