Together the two units (Manuscript Project A and Manuscript Project B) provide an opportunity for a sustained piece of writing to be developed over two sessions. There are no classes or workshops: students work independently with regular written and verbal feedback from a writing supervisor. At the completion of this unit, students will have completed either a full manuscript or the opening 25,000 words of a longer work. It is expected that the final work will be of a potentially publishable standard. Application is open to students who have demonstrated excellent progress in their writing units and have submitted a compelling and potentially publishable project plan.
