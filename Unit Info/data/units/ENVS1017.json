    "description": "The living environment is all around us – dynamic landscapes, water, air and environmental systems that underpin life on Earth. This unit focuses on critical environmental processes that create and modify physical environments on land, at the coast, and in the atmosphere. Issues of variability, change and human impacts on the environment are examined. We link theory and practical field, modelling and analysis skills to view and understand complex Earth-surface environments. Field and laboratory activities include assessment of river health and water quality, wetlands, coasts and anthropogenic impacts, and measurement of micro-climatic processes. Geographic information systems (GIS) are introduced to visualise and aid spatial analysis and interpretation of the environment. This unit is fundamental to all natural sciences, but particularly earth and environmental sciences, environmental management and ecology. The content is relevant for various environmental science and management careers including consultancies, government agencies, and non-government organisations, where many gradates find employment.",
