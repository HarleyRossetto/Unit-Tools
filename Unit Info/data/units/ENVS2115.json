        "description": "We will be using a custom designed and built, online learning tool; “The ReadinGAME”. This game is designed to operate on a calendar week cycle, and involves you being able to ask a question related on the week’s material from the readings and lectures. You will then be able to answer questions posed by other students, and most importantly, you will not only be able to score points for correctly answering the questions, but you will also be able to comment and discuss the questions, and rate whether they are good/not so good questions etc. Importantly, in the process you will be learning and reinforcing the week’s material as well as having a lot of fun- it can be quite addictive.\nTo play, follow the link in iLearn, and simply ask a question relevant to the weeks material. You will then be able to play, by answering other questions and watching how your score accumulates. You will also be able to give feedback on other people’s questions and monitor your performance. There are multiple scoring paths, and different types of scores to achieve, depending on your interests.\nAt the end of the semester, there will be a quiz based on questions derived from the ReadinGAME.\n",
