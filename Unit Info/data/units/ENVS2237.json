    "description": "The importance of natural hazards and their impacts is growing as population increases and the world is increasingly overshadowed by a changing climate. Natural hazards include those from the solid earth, such as earthquakes and volcanoes; weather-related impacts from floods, tropical cyclones, drought and bushfires; biohazards; and rarer &#39;megahazards&#39; such as asteroid impacts. The impacts from natural hazards can cause humanitarian disasters and cost billions of dollars. But what are the most important hazards, and where do the disasters occur? How can we manage and reduce disaster impacts? This unit approaches natural hazards via an understanding of how they occur, what they do and how we can mitigate their impacts. This approach allows future societies to be more resilient to the impacts of natural hazards.",
