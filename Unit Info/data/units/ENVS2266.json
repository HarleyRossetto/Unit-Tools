This unit examines earth surface processes from a catchment perspective: hill slopes and soils; rivers and floodplains; and the materials, including contaminants, that comprise them. We draw on Australian and overseas examples from diverse environments to demonstrate how biophysical processes shape our landscape. Students gain practical, laboratory and field-based skills that help them interpret the landscape. These are taught in both on-campus sessions and weekend field trips. This unit builds on themes introduced in ENVS1017 and GEOS1110, and provides a sound conceptual background for students continuing in environmental sciences, environmental management and courses in ecology, biology, geology and archaeology.",
