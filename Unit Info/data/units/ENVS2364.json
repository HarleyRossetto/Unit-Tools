Students will develop broad theoretical skills in geospatial technologies, and practical skills for acquiring and managing spatial data, analysing, visualising and synthesising spatial data, and the principles for applying these skills to real-world problems across a range of disciplines, including environmental science and management, physical and human geography, urban planning, biodiversity conservation, archaeology, health, business and marketing. Adding geospatial technology skills  to your undergraduate or graduate program can help you identify new areas of research and applications thereby strengthening your career prospects.",
