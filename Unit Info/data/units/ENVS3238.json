This unit assesses environmental health using current practice qualitative and quantitative methods for the measurement of soils, sediments, waters and biota. Students undertake classroom, field and laboratory studies which provide practical experience and develop their knowledge and assessment of environmental impacts, rehabilitation and management. A field trip in the first week of the mid session break gives students practical experience of sites such as derelict mines. This unit prepares graduates for employment in environmental consulting and local, state and federal government workplaces. Students will also prepare material to assist with their transition to the workplace.",
