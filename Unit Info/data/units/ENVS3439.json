    "description": "This unit is offered as an intensive, block-mode unit in February every year. It is offered at both advanced undergraduate level and as a professional development course. Pre-course private study and assessment is followed by four days on-campus focussed on developing knowledge for the geomorphic analysis of rivers. Topics include interactions of river forms and processes, assessment of river behaviour and change, river evolution, impacts of human disturbance to rivers, and sediment budgets. Students then apply their skills and knowledge to geomorphic analysis of rivers in a real-world setting during a 4-day off-campus fieldtrip, as well as explore pressing challenges for their conservation and management. This is followed by 4 days on-campus focussed on principles and strategies for river and wetland conservation, management and rehabilitation within an Australian context. Graduates are employed in a range of local, state and federal agencies, catchment management authorities, consultancies, and industry. For further information about the professional development option, please contact the unit convenor.",
