    "description": "This unit is for students from a broad range of backgrounds interested in pursuing postgraduate study in earth and environmental sciences and management. Environmental concepts and topics are examined that are central to understanding the living environment – dynamic landscapes, water, air and environmental systems that underpin life on Earth. The unit focuses on terrestrial, coastal, and atmospheric environments, and we make use of geographic information systems (GIS) to visualise and aid spatial analysis and interpretation. This unit uses the local environment as a living laboratory to explore a combination of theory, field, modelling and analysis skills related to river health and water quality, wetlands, coasts and micro-climatic processes. The foundation knowledge and skills developed relating to environmental science, management and sustainability will facilitate higher-level studies, and are desirable for environmental careers in consultancies, government agencies, and non-government organisations.",
