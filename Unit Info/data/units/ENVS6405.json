Contemporary examples, such as the management of river systems and managing bushfire regimes, are used to illustrate the complexity of environmental management. While hands-on practicals, field visits and assessment tasks support the development of technical and professional skills needed for careers in environmental science, policy, social science, planning and geography. The unit is accessible for students with degrees from a broad range of backgrounds, and develops foundational knowledge and skills relating to the environment and sustainability in order to facilitate higher level studies.",
