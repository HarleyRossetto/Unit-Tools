This unit focuses on the scientific framework for understanding  climate change, and covers (a) the multiple drivers of climate change, (b) the role of physical and biogeochemical feedbacks in the climate system, (c) climate change projections, (d) impacts from anthropogenic climate change including those from extreme events and (e) the principles of mitigation and adaptation of climate change and how they are performed under national and international context. It will provide students with the background to critically evaluate current understanding of the complex interactions that determine climate trajectories, the reliability of the tools used to make climate-impact projections and the effectiveness of various mitigation and adaptation strategies.",
