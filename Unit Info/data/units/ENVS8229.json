Major themes include city biodiversity and blue-green infrastructure (e.g. green walls and living seawalls), waste management (e.g. scientific innovation to support a circular economy and smart sensing technologies), air, land and water pollution (e.g. regulation and reduction through water sensitive urban design), and resource management (e.g. urban agriculture and vertical farming). The challenges for sustainable cities in a changing climate will be explored through each major theme. Different local, national and international case studies will be explored to demonstrate key concepts in the science and management of sustainable cities. The unit includes a field trip where students will apply their knowledge to enhance sustainability in an urban context.",
