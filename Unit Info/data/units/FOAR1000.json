Drawing upon the idea of situated knowledge this unit explores the learning that takes place in the process of engaged observation and practice in Indigenous contexts. Students will be introduced to the concept of Indigenous knowledges and Indigenous ways of knowing, doing and being. Students will also be active educators and draw on their own knowledges and share with other learners. This unit looks at knowledge in relation to land, water and sky, among many topics, and the way in which knowledge is applied in traditional and contemporary modes. Students who complete this unit can enrol in FOAR1001 in session two.",
