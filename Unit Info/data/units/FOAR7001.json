Through a combination of faculty-level and departmental seminars it will provide students with advanced disciplinary knowledge about research processes, practice and planning, with a particular focus on research writing and communication. Students will be exposed to leading research in their discipline and learn about the mindsets, habits and practices that shape the way researchers communicate knowledge for a range of different outputs and audiences. Through a variety of research-related communication activities students will have the opportunity to demonstrate competence in the application of generic research and communication skills to their area of research, and to produce written material that will provide an ideal foundation for their eventual second-year MRES research project and future academic writing.",
