World-ready researchers must not only be able to navigate the digital sphere and recognise the potential offered by digital technology for their own research, but must also understand the ethics surrounding digital technologies and data management practices. In this unit, students will encounter the dynamic and exciting possibilities that digital technologies create for researchers in the arts. They will learn how to think critically and creatively about potential new directions for research, and how these might be applied to their own disciplines and research practices. Students will learn how to harness digital tools and technologies to enhance, optimise and automate their own research practices. They will also gain essential skills in learning how to think critically about the issues and ethics facing researchers regarding data management and digital research practices and communication. Students will emerge from this unit with an understanding of the exciting new possibilities emerging at the ever-evolving digital frontier, an awareness of the ethical questions involved in digital research, and the ability to apply digital tools and concepts to their own research practices.",
