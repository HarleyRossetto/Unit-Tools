You will write a blog post (900 words) or make a short podcast (15 min) where you engage with a piece of writing or media that applies the concept of neoliberalism, and reflect on how the term is being used drawing on the material in the first 5 weeks of the unit. This is not a traditional research essay, and we do not expect a full reference list or formal referencing. However, the piece should use links or (verbal) references to key thinkers or texts to guide the audience to see the links between theories/theorists from the course and your analysis.",

    "description": "This unit introduces key themes and theorists in contemporary social and political theory. In particular, it will explore competing diagnoses and responses to the winding back of the post-war compromises between democratic states and corporate capitalism. Rather than taking a serial approach to a study of social and political theories, the unit will focus on their, at times diametrically opposed, configurations of this broad problem complex. In an epoch in which neoliberal agendas have both provoked, and perhaps also been facilitated by, the surge of populist politics across the globe, we look to contemporary social and political theories to help us make sense of new developments, to diagnose their costs and unravel future potentials. Can social democratic reformism survive the era of Trump, Brexit and Hanson? Organised as a workshop series, the unit will draw from leading theorists such as: Agamben, Boltanski, Brown, Chakrabarty, Fraser, Foucault, Habermas, Harvey, Honneth, Peck. Examining a problematic that is of foundational importance in much current social and political research, this unit is relevant to students across the humanities and social sciences.",
