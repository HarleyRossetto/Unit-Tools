This unit introduces students to transnational and global approaches to the study of cultural texts. We examine the contested theoretical frameworks associated with the study of texts and cultures across national borders, including globalisation, postcolonialism, transnationalism, internationalism, diaspora, and world literature. In the process, we analyse how culture relates to global systems and networks, from the transnational avant-garde to popular culture, and from “little magazines” to the internet. This unit adopts a transdisciplinary approach, combining social and political theory, analysis of a wide range of cultural texts and artefacts, and diverse methods for cultural research, using varied sources. Students work towards the development of an independent research essay, and are encouraged to bring their own backgrounds and research interests to bear in both class and assessments. It is taught by a diverse range of scholars, and is associated with the Global Literatures and Cultures research group.",
