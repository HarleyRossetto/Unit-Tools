The family and home are often considered private sites, but they are also popular topics of intense public debate and major targets of government intervention. In this unit, we examine the increasingly diverse ways in which family life is imagined and practised in contemporary societies. The focus is on how families are bound up with gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, class and nation-states. By exploring topics such as work-life balance, marriage and friends-as-family, students interpret the changing landscapes of families, and analyse the interlinkage between their personal lives and wider social and cultural changes. The central aim is to understand important current  issues concerning families so that we can generate ideas to build a just world.",
