    "description": "In this unit, we explore the cultural history of and links between sexuality, gender, race, and rock music. Influenced by black and working-class cultures, and with sexuality embedded in its form and practice, rock music has challenged and transformed existing norms of family, sex and gender. Music has also been a site of struggle between the freedom that music enables and the commodification that spreads music globally. We begin with slave songs in the nineteenth century and travel through the 1950s boom of rock&#39;n&#39;roll and Elvis, the 1960s British Invasion, the 1970s emergence of disco, the 1980s MTV revolution and hip hop, and conclude with Laura Jane Grace, Beyonce, and the contemporary music scene. Along the way, we uncover the hidden histories and pioneering contributions of women, explore how glam rock, disco, and MTV laid the foundations of performative gender and queer theories, and learn how social identities and ideals have been reflected in and shaped by rock music.",
