This unit equips students to engage with these issues by introducing the key approaches used by geographers to explore and explain the spatial variations and interconnections of political, cultural, social, economic and environmental processes that shape the world today. The unit draws on historical and contemporary case studies to examine a range of different geographical perspectives, while maintaining a focus on the core concepts and theories that constitute the discipline of human geography. The unit ultimately aims to provide an understanding of how the discipline of geography is understood and practiced, and explore how geographic knowledge and skills can be used to analyse contemporary social and environmental challenges.",
