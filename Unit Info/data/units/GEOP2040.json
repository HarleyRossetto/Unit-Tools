    "description": "This unit provides a geographical perspective on development issues facing cities of the global South. A series of case studies are drawn upon, particularly from the Asia Pacific region, to highlight key social, economic, political and environmental issues, how they are being addressed and hopeful ways forward. The unit is structured around five themes, each providing a different viewpoint on cities and development. First, the unit introduces the concept of the global South and key urban development theories. It then explores how shared histories of colonialism and post-colonial development have shaped cities in the global South. Section three explores life in the city, looking at how people make a living, housing challenges, informality, mobility, and inequality. Section four concentrates upon environmental issues, the sustainable development goals, and how cities are entangled in processes of social and ecological change. Finally the unit reviews a range of policy interventions and considers the role of different actors in responding to development challenges and pursuing more just and resilient urban futures. Throughout the unit students will have the opportunity to focus in on a particular city of their choice and develop a deep understanding its past, present and future.",
