    "description": "The Anthropocene is a proposed new geological epoch in which humanity is driving planetary change. This unit explores how environmental decision making and planning processes can be made more just in the context of the Anthropocene.  It draws on perspectives from environmental justice, a field of research and activism focused on addressing the social and geographic inequities associated with environmental change. Environmental justice highlights how responsibility for, and the burdens of, environmental degradation are unevenly distributed across space and scale, and divided between and within social categories such as race, class, gender, ethnicity and species. Environmental justice and decision-making are analysed through a series of case studies that are presented by academic staff and environmental professionals. An important component of the unit focuses on developing analytical and practical skills for pursuing environmental justice, which requires the ability to synthesise geographic information from the social and physical sciences and engage with multiple stakeholders, decision making tools, and forms of communication. The unit makes the relationships between justice and environment more visible in a world of rapid environmental change and provides pathways and tools for pursuing more just and resilient futures.",
