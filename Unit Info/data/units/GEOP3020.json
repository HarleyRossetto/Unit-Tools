    "description": "Disasters and extreme events, such as storms, floods, disease or bushfires, cause significant social, economic and environmental upheaval that directly affects people and places around the world. Resilience refers to the capacity of communities to anticipate, prepare and adapt to the risk of disaster and respond and recover when events occur. In the context of rapid climate change and ecological degradation, it is becoming increasingly urgent that communities plan for disaster and develop resilience strategies. This unit examines the social and biophysical origins of contemporary disasters, how disasters unfold at a range of sites and scales, how they are shaped by diverse geographies and vulnerabilities, the limits of community resilience, and how resilience can be improved. Contemporary cases from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region will be used to highlight key issues and policy debates. Overall, the unit will provide an understanding in both theory and practice about the ways in which communities respond to disaster and allow students to develop the skills and knowledge needed to pursue more resilient futures.",
