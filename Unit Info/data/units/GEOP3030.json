In this unit, students will analyse the meanings of liveability and consider policies and projects related to making cities and regions more liveable, such as smart and green infrastructure, transport and mobilities, urban activation and place-making. The unit focuses on the role of planning in making connections that improve the relationships between infrastructure, mobility and place. Overall, students will gain critical insights and practical knowledge of urban policies, governance structures and plans, as well the ethics and values, that underpin the goal of creating more liveable and connected cities.",
