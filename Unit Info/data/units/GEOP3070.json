This unit explores the role of firms, households and governments in shaping economic processes in cities, with a focus on Australian cities. The unit will explore four key themes. First, the unit investigates the major international and domestic drivers of the urban economy. Second, the unit explores some of the main theoretical approaches used in economic geography to understand urban economic processes. Third, financial processes related to infrastructure delivery and land/housing economics are investigated. Finally, issues of urban productivity, employment and disadvantage are explored. Through the investigation of theory, economic and planning policy and detailed analysis of case studies, students will develop an understanding of the complex economic processes which shape cities.",
