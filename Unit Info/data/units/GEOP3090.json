This unit offers you an advanced introduction to key theoretical paradigms and to the ways in which they have influenced geographical and planning imaginations. A key focus of the unit is the use of theory to develop critical, situated and ethical standpoints that inform academic and professional practice. ‘Thinking Space’ will help you to develop these skills by learning how to identify your own theoretical perspectives in relation to the perspectives of others. You will work individually and in groups on themes related to the critical study of space and apply theoretical perspectives to the historical and lived conditions experienced by different groups over time.",
