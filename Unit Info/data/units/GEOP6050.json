Bringing together geographic perspectives from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, it examines the concepts of environment, sustainability, and society, together with their past and possible future socio-political and economic framings. The historical and contemporary contexts of key environmental issues in Australia are explained along with their connections to global events and perspectives, including climate change, invasive species, water management, environmental protection movements, and links between consumption and production. Current planning frameworks and management processes, including legal and legislative mechanisms are also considered, along with emerging strategies and social movements that aim to address existing and expected problems.",
