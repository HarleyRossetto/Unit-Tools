The unit explores the role of population change (fertility, mortality, migration and ageing) in influencing the growth and structure of our cities. Second, the role of housing as a central element of urban change and urban planning policy is explored. Students will examine issues of housing affordability, social and community housing options, and the role of home ownership and private rental in Australian cities. The unit analyses new forms of housing delivery, such as urban renewal and regeneration, which provide opportunities to address the housing crisis facing many of our cities. Finally, the unit investigates processes of urban regeneration across Australian cities. The unit explores the drivers behind large regeneration projects, as well as the policies and development processes which deliver them on the ground. Central to the unit is the exploration of possible policy responses (including urban planning and broader social and economic policy) for addressing many of the challenges facing our cities. Students will develop an understanding of how population and housing processes shape cities.",
