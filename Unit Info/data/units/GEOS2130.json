With a focus on marine sedimentology, we will examine the formation, accumulation, alteration, and preservation of sediments in the geological record. We will cover the basics of fluid flow and sediment transport, sedimentary textures and structures, and illustrate the connections between modern landforms and ancient rocks/depositional environments. This unit will focus on the reconstruction and interpretation of ancient palaeo-environments based on the analysis of sedimentary structures, stratigraphy, and fossils. The unit will include practical components as well as a fieldtrip to the New South Wales south coast.",
