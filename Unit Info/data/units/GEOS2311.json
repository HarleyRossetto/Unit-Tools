This unit introduces the most important geophysical methods currently used by engineers, earth and environmental scientists to understand and provide solutions to a large number of scientific and society-relevant problems (infrastructure development, groundwater contamination, geohazards, urban development, resource exploration, monitoring of pollution plumes, etc). Included are the methods of collecting and interpreting gravity, magnetic, seismic and electrical data and their use in mapping and charactering subsurface conditions. Practical classes involve reducing and interpreting geophysical data from earth and environmental problems. Data from a field survey is used to interpret the geological structure and environmental aspects of the dataset.",
