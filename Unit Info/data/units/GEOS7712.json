    "description": "This unit describes and explores the underpinnings of the tools employed in geochronology and inorganic geochemistry in order to unravel the timing and duration of geological phenomena. Primarily focused on high temperature geochemistry, this course will employ applications spanning from diffusion modelling in magma chambers, through zircon geochronology to model ages in addition to tracing the passage of materials through the solid Earth. A background in the analytical techniques used to attain such data is also included. Negotiation between staff and students develops a number of case studies to allow students to acquire practical skills applicable to a wide range of research areas. Case studies may include: (i) understanding trace element partitioning and behaviour, (ii) investigating the effect of volatiles on the physics and chemistry of rock properties and melt, (iii) modelling the mineralogy of planetary interiors and (iv) geothermobarometry. This unit is suitable for students outside of Earth and Environmental Sciences, particularly those developing research skills in Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences",
