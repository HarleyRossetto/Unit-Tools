The thesis together with four core research activities form a single coherent research program based on individual research plans and will consist of the following: (1) Research Frontiers 2: You will attend a number of department or faculty-run sessions and engage in a program of activities developing your knowledge of the sub-disciplinary field in which you want to situate your own research; (2) Literature Review: You will attend sessions explaining how researchers in your field engage with previous research literature, and produce a draft of your own literature review for your thesis; (3) Research Methods: With other students and led by academic staff, you will develop the research methods you will use in your research project; (4) Research Planning: Through a combination of group sessions and individual work with your supervision team, you will develop a plan for a large scale research project, part of which will be completed in the MRes; and (5) Thesis: You will complete a small research project, and write it up in a short thesis of about 20,000 words.",
