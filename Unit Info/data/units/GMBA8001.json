Organisations have changed from being hierarchical and silo-ed towards being flatter and team-driven. Now, more than ever, the manner by which people are managed and led has become crucial for organisational success. This unit considers a range of concepts, theories, and methodologies to navigate and optimise workplace relationships in this new organisational context. Students learn how to motivate and manage people in their organisation, focusing on strategy, employee experience and performance management. Through structured learning activities, students examine the available evidence concerning the approaches and contingencies that enhance employee, team and organisational outcomes through the lenses of talent, diversity and culture, as well as human resource management, and advance strategies to enact positive outcomes in simulated and real-life scenarios. Particular focus is placed on the changes associated with the future of work and their implications for managing people in complex and dynamic environments.",
