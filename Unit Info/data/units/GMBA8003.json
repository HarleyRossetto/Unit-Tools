In exploring this shift, the unit critically examines Henry Mintzberg&#39;s observation that much of a leader&#39;s time is spent dealing with never-ending and relentlessly occurring complex and ambiguous interruptions of a messy organisational reality and the necessity of having to adopt adaptive and resilient practices to cope. Students will examine how the digital transformation of work has dramatically altered the perception of leadership, with all organisational members being expected to take on some form of self-leadership in the complex team and project work that is increasingly framing the &#34;future of work&#34;. This demand is causing tensions between the expectations of traditional leaders and the good and emergent practices and strategies necessary to being agile and nimble in today&#39;s ultra-competitive and increasingly disruptive marketplace. Students will be asked to critically examine what adaptive practices of leadership and followership might be employed to minimise these tensions, and the dysfunctionality that accompanies them.",
