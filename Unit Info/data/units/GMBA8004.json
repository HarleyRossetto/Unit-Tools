This unit addresses this challenge using the lenses of leadership, vision and identity. Drawing on theories such as internal marketing, the unit explores how students, as leaders, can create a compelling vision and understand how to communicate with impact and meaning. Students will also understand how to build personal power to exert influence and how to harness the transformative power of social identity to sustain commitment to the vision. Special attention will be given to the role of identity in leading across cultures and borders. In exploring these concepts, the unit will also build an understanding of how storytelling can engage and influence people beyond traditional approaches to communication. This unit will also explore the role of brands and visual identity in organisational success. Students will develop awareness of brand identity and the role of brand in clarifying and reinforcing the vision, both within the organisation, and for partners and customers.",
