    "description": "The ability to generate strategic insights is an expectation for the &#34;future of work&#34; but what does this actually mean? Are there universal principles of strategic thinking that can help us become more effective at developing insights? And how can these strategic insights help an organisation become more competitive? This unit examines the basic elements of strategy through a set of rich and nuanced business models. It covers classic strategic questions and topics with an emphasis on diverse and emergent themes, such as open innovation and strategy, networks, platforms and other business model innovations, and the processes and practices of strategy, and their effects. Students apply the tools and techniques of contemporary strategic analysis and also reflect on the doing of strategy in the context of their own business or workplace, and other real cases. In parallel, students are encouraged to develop a reflective and critical perspective on the implications and impacts of taken-for-granted strategy thinking, concepts and tools, and conversely are asked to consider the future of strategy, centred on how strategic management can provide solutions for pressing sustainability-related societal-level challenges.",
