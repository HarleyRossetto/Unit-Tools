    "description": "Globalisation has fundamentally transformed the business landscape. Rapid changes in emerging economies present a number of implications for doing business. This unit enables students to develop and evaluate strategies for operating and competing on a global scale. It explores a range of factors such as global supply chain risk management, offshoring, and supplier selection. Students will also develop a strategic perspective on international business by understanding the design of logistics networks in different countries, as well as the importance of cultural diversification on the broader ecosystem. The unit examines questions such as: How should a global supply chain and its operations be managed? How can global supply chains ensure continuity of operations in light of various internal and external sources of disruptions? What are the main criteria to be considered for offshoring part of their operations to a different geographical location? What is the strategic logic that should inform such decisions, and what are the main risks to manage? And how do you decide which international markets to enter or avoid? Are cultural differences still an important consideration, and, if so, how do you manage them?",
