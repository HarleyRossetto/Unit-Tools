    "description": "Trust in business and CEOs is declining around the world. Large corporate scandals continue to make headlines, and issues such as a lack of diversity, tax evasion by international conglomerates, and the growing pay gap between executives and employees continue to draw widespread criticism. Why is it that generally sensible business leaders who are employed not only to maximise financial returns, but also to protect their company&#39;s reputation, can sometimes find themselves behaving unethically? Are corporate scandals usually caused by a few &#34;bad apples&#34;, or are their underlying causes more systemic? And how can you prevent them? Is an increased focus on ethics training and/or Corporate Social Responsibility the answer to reversing the general decline in societal trust? And why should these questions be of strategic concern to CEOs? In this unit students will expand their strategic thinking skills beyond a firm&#39;s competitive environment to include the company&#39;s impact on the broader society. Students will learn why it is important to manage business ethics as a collective rather than an individual issue, and will be challenged to grapple with the tensions between maximising financial returns and societal impact in order to be able to manage a sustainable balance between the two.",
