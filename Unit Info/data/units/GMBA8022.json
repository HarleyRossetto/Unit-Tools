This unit provides students with the understanding of the tools and techniques in financial management. The main goal is to prepare students for responsible and sustainable leadership using the financial management perspective. The unit develops a framework around financial analysis and modeling, as well as business, risk, and investment evaluation by focusing on four main areas: (1) the assessment of an organisation’s financial health, (2) the planning of the organisation’s future financial performance, (3) the financing of the organisation’s operations, and (4) the evaluation of business and investment opportunities for the organisation. Emphasis is placed on the application of tools and techniques to real world problems in financial management to enable students to solve related problems in their place of work.",
