    "description": "This unit introduces students to a range of analytical tools and skills to understand, analyse and evaluate challenges and opportunities today&#39;s organisations are facing. Students will examine a range of environmental, social and economic drivers of megatrends (associated with technological, socio-cultural, political, economic and ecological forces) influencing organisations, industry sectors and societies. They will explore how these changes/trends can be addressed through sustainability-oriented innovation approaches. Students will become familiar with systems thinking, multi-level perspectives and multidisciplinary methods for envisioning futures, and will apply these to specific problems. The unit focuses on developing students&#39; analytical skills, such as research, critical thinking, scanning, pattern recognition and creative problem solving. An emphasis on future-proofing skills such as the ability to work in teams, to collaborate with multiple stakeholders with diverse needs, and to account for judgements made within ethical decision making frameworks will also be covered.",
