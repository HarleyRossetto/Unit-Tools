    "description": "Pressures associated with globalisation and advances in information and communication technology have resulted in a 24x7 work environment characterised by rapid change, increasing sense of competition, and an explosion in access to communication and information. These pressures can lead to feelings of stress about being overloaded with work and information processing, which not only reduces performance but can also lead to a reduced sense of meaning and purpose about life as well as physical and mental health problems. This course will focus on the nature of contemporary stressors facing leaders in today&#39;s work environments and the approaches one can use to deal with this situation. In particular the issue of building your personal resilience - your capacity to withstand and cope with stress - will be explored. Underpinning resilience and management of stress is a set of strategies that relate to how you manage yourself, how you motivate yourself at work, and how you organise your work and time. Additionally, resilience is impacted by one&#39;s health, and the extent and quality of social relationships dimensions. Understanding the nature of stress and how to deal with stress and building your resilience are essential skills for leaders and play a vital role in managing the demands you face at work in changing the work environment.",
