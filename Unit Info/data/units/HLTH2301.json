The diversity of stressors influencing the human body and mind is explored, and the response of the body to them is discussed. This includes adaptations at both cellular and tissue levels of organisation, inflammation, the immune response, tissue death and neoplasia. The immunisation debate and other relevant public health issues are explored. The relationship between the brain, &#39;mind&#39;, immune and endocrine systems is also studied. By the conclusion of this unit, students will have an understanding of the complex relationship between ourselves and our environment.",
