Their causes, mechanisms and effects are explored. The links between these disease mechanisms and their clinical manifestations is highlighted. By the completion of this unit, students will have completed their study of the major diseases of the body, and how they manifest in the patient. This will ultimately deepen their understanding of the complex relationship between ourselves and our environment.",
