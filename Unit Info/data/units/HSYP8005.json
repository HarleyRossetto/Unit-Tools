You will focus on infectious disease epidemiology to learn about how diseases spread both locally and globally. You will explore the concepts of source of infection and immunity, surveillance as a tool for understanding burden of disease and impact of control strategies, and outbreak investigations to identify sources and management of disease spread. You will explore these themes through case studies such as sexually transmissible diseases, HIV/AIDS and vaccine preventable diseases. You will explore current out-break investigations and infectious disease surveillance methods; and will learn how key aspects of, and innovations in, infectious disease management have impacted on public health law, management and policy.",
