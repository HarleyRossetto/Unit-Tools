In this unit you will develop an understanding of the relationships between nutrition, food security and health in Australia and globally. You will learn about key nutrients for human health in terms of their function, dietary sources and different nutritional requirements at various life stages; and then explore the factors that influence dietary behaviours and habits and their relationship to chronic diseases. We will train you to evaluate methods used to determine nutritional status and explore nutrition related policies, guidelines and programs used to prevent unhealthy dietary behaviours and consequently reduce the prevalence of chronic conditions. Also, you will explore global nutrition issues including nutrition transition, food security and environmental sustainability. ",
