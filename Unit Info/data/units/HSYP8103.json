In the law module, you will learn to identify appropriate instruments and mechanisms to write and critique legal documents such as a policy paper. You will explore international, national and local legal frameworks, with a focus on the functions of the United Nations. In the health economics module, you will learn about the structural and financial aspects of a health system, including funding arrangements and economic evaluations that are used to help decision-makers identify cost-effective solutions to health care problems. You will be able to integrate your previous learning in the program to examine ways in which health law, economics and policy advance public health. The unit is delivered through lectures, tutorials and online activities.",
