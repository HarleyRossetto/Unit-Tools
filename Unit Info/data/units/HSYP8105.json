Health care systems are complex consisting of many interacting components, people and perspectives. You will learn about systems theories (for example, resilience, consumer participation, and sociotechnical perspectives) and apply them to examine policy and practice underpinning public health problems. The unit is delivered by experts in health systems, including digital health informatics, safe systems and systems evaluation methods. You will learn through guest lectures, tutorials, online activities and assessments requiring you to analyse real-life case studies and evaluate health interventions.",
