    "description": "Learning and using languages requires navigating the complexities of human interaction. This unit introduces students to the fundamentals of how language functions as a social tool and is used to negotiate complex systems of interaction in our increasingly globalised everyday life. With the aim to facilitate students&#39; understanding of foreign languages and language learning, the unit covers a wide variety of key concepts including language systems, language acquisition, and socio-cultural variation in languages. Class discussions employ examples from multiple languages, and require active study that develops both practical language skills and understanding of key concepts. By the end of this unit, students will develop autonomous learning skills, an appreciation of major theories on language, and a deep awareness of the importance of intercultural communicative competence within our daily lives. Lectures will be delivered in English. Tutorials will be offered in either English or one of the languages taught in the Department of Media, Communications, Creative Arts, Language and Literature, incorporating concrete language and cultural activities in relation to LOTE. ",
