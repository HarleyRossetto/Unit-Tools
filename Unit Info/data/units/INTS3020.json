    "description": "Reading across cultures and languages enables intercultural understanding. This Unit offers students intercultural perspectives on the study of literature and translation across different languages. It introduces students to the history and theory of literatures beyond national, linguistic and cultural borders. Students will learn to interpret these literatures by applying relevant literary theories to them. They will interrogate the concept of cultural translation by considering what is at stake in the translation of texts across languages and related cultures. In practical terms, students will then consider the choices made when translating literary texts by reading case studies and through their own creative translation practice. Lectures will be delivered in English. Tutorials will facilitate students applying speaking, listening, reading and writing skills in the target language and culture. <br />",
