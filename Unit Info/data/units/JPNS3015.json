Placing a particular focus on the study of popular culture as a site to acquire sophisticated understandings of Japanese society, students will gain advanced insight into the socio-cultural, political, and economic influences which shape contemporary Japan. Working with authentic Japanese media texts, the unit builds students’ Japanese cultural literacy and prepares them for careers in either Japan or which require significant engagement with Japan. Further, the unit situates the study of Japanese contemporary culture within the broader context of the global media landscape, extending students’ intercultural communicative competence through engagement with a range of sources in both Japanese and English. Students will complete reflective and persuasive writing tasks based in critically engaging with Japanese media, developing advanced skills in research and communication.",
