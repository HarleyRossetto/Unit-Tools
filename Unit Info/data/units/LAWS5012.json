The unit will consider the history, sources and development of specific crimes in the international and domestic arena, theories of compliance and criminal enforcement. Crimes will be examined at a number of different levels.

From a practical perspective, examining specific criminal acts and the global regimes will inform students understanding of the prevention and resolution of international conflict, and the promotion of criminal justice in such arenas as human trafficking, slavery, &#39;blood diamonds&#39;, money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
