These are just some of the questions this course addresses. Corporations are powerful and complex legal creations with immense influence over society, economy, politics and environment. In this advanced unit, students will build on existing knowledge of business organisations and corporate law to gain deeper insight into how corporations govern themselves and how they are regulated by external actors, both in Australia and internationally. Students will engage in research and critical analysis of existing corporate governance strategies and the laws that govern corporate interactions, advancing their understanding of the actors and organisations that impact corporate governance, including: corporate boards, corporate regulators, auditors and stock exchanges. This course provides an opportunity to explore concepts such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Environmental and Social Governance (ESG), and Business and Human Rights. Students will analyse the relationships and legal obligations between corporations and their shareholders, creditors, employees and customers. ",
