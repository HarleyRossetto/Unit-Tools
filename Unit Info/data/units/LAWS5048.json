    "description": "This unit is concerned with the role of the law in regulating our interactions with animals. It considers important philosophical, ethical, legal and regulatory questions regarding the treatment of animals. How should animals be treated in modern-day society? Why are some animals afforded greater protections than others? How does one determine what is necessary and unnecessary harm in the treatment of animals? Should animals be conceptualised as personal property or afforded some or all of the protections available to legal persons? Students will be exposed to a range of ideas that will inform their analysis of the contemporary animal welfare legislative framework. Regulatory arrangements will be examined and contrasted in relation to: companion animals; farm animals; animals used in commercial food (or other) production; wildlife, including protected species; and animals used in scientific experimentation, zoos and circuses. Significant international developments in animal law will be considered, and avenues for public interest litigation explored. Students will be presented with practical case studies, a rich diversity of perspectives from a range of expert speakers and the opportunity to research particular areas of interest. This unit is designed to be thought-provoking and to challenge previous conceptions and assumptions regarding non-human animals.",
