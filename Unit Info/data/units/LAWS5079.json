We will explore the historical and political climate in which international instruments and domestic policies were created, and the contemporary context in which they are implemented. This unit adopts an interdisciplinary approach to understand and critically engage with the legal frameworks governing the rights of refugees and other forced migrants. Students will develop a robust understanding of the international refugee law system, as well as its implementation and operation in Australia and abroad. This will involve an examination of the elements of the refugee definition in the Convention on the Status of Refugees and other relevant protections under international law, mechanisms in place for refugee status determination and appeals, and the jurisprudence that has developed internationally and in Australia relating to the rights of asylum seekers, refugees and other persons in need of protection.",
