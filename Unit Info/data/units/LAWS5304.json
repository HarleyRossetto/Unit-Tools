This provides an excellent opportunity for students to engage in the study of law in a foreign jurisdiction, gain important skills of cultural competence and experience living and studying in another country. Students are generally permitted to study Law units that are pre-approved by the Macquarie Law School Exchange Officer as the equivalent of a 5000 level elective. This may consist of a single Law unit studied overseas, or a combination of units that together, meet the equivalent of 150 hours of study at 5000 level. Students cannot get credit on exchange for any compulsory Macquarie Law school unit. The content and assessment of any unit is determined by the host University and the credit granted by Macquarie Law School is ungraded and does not count toward a student&#39;s WAM.
