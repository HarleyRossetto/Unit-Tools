In this unit, students work under the close supervision of the academic convenor of the unit and their research supervisor to develop a thesis that addresses a contemporary legal problem.  Students work to identify the appropriate legal research methodology to address their research question and then apply that methodology to answer the question in the form of an 8000 word thesis.  This unit requires advanced legal research skills, the ability to engage in self directed research under supervision and superior legal writing ability. Students will learn to design research projects with rigorous research methodologies, to proffer good written analyses with sound argumentation, and to reflect on legal scholarship and on the law critically while conducted ethical research.",
