Students who do not achieve a 75% pass mark on their first attempt will be allowed a second and, if necessary, third attempt. No more than 3 attempts will be allowed. There is a mandatory minimum 24 hour delay between attempts. All attempts must be made during the 5-day time period that the quiz is open.
