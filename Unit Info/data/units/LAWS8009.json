    "description": "Property is a fundamental legal concept in contemporary western societies. In this unit the property concept is examined from theoretical and practical perspectives. Initially, the question of what the concept should encompass is raised, looking particularly at the person/property distinction and at the boundaries of property such as ownership of the human body and its parts and digital property. Moral implications and economic justifications for the allocation of property rights are then introduced. The major portion of the unit is concerned with a thorough examination of the practical application of property law in Australia beginning with the law of personal property and continuing with systems of title to land (old system, Torrens and native title), the primary interests in land such as mortgages, easements, leases and covenants and concurrent ownership. Analytical and problem solving skills are developed through hypothetical problem exercises and careful consideration of authoritative case law.",
