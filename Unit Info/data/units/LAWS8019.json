    "description": "This final year unit draws together doctrinal, theoretical and practical knowledge and experience in the study of law through a focus on the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in the Australian and international context. Students are encouraged to think critically about the ways that legal disputes are typically resolved and the extent to which developments in the ADR field have been integrated into legal practice and regulation. This unit consolidates student learning on the range of legal remedies available through a comparison of ADR processes including negotiation, mediation, arbitration and restorative justice. This unit also provides students with an opportunity to consolidate high level communication skills by providing simulated opportunities for legal negotiations and to further develop the discipline specific communication skills required in conflict resolution processes.",
