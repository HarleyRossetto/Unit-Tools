Taxation of various kinds is the primary means by which wealth can be distributed: inequities and distortions can promote investment in specific economic activities, encourage or discourage savings and lead to exploitation and avoidance by the wealthy through the use of loopholes and complex business structures. Ultimately, this affects the government&#39;s ability to provide essential social services such as health, education and housing. The second part of the unit entails a sophisticated examination of the fundamental elements of the Australian taxation system including residency, income, deductions, capital gains tax and the taxation of trusts. ",
