In this unit students will study the foundational elements of contract law such as the formation of contract, the characterisation and interpretation of contractual terms, factors which vitiate the formation of a valid contract, the requirement for consideration, privity of contract and the discharge of contractual liabilities. Greater depth of understanding of significant issues in the historical and contemporary development of contract law is achieved through the examination and critique of competing philosophies of contract and international comparisons. Problem solving skills are also developed and tested through hypothetical problem questions. Research skills are tested with a research assignment. ",
