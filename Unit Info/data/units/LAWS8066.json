With regard to both historical and contemporary social policies in Australia, the unit examines questions of how effectively the Australian legal system regulates issues particular to Indigenous peoples.  The unit explores these issues in Australia, and also looks to the International legal community and the experience of other settler-colonised states in understanding the limits of law in protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples. The unit canvasses indigenous law in a variety of contexts including land rights and native title, family law and child protection, the criminal justice system, and Indigenous ownership of intellectual and cultural property.",
