Students will develop vital employability skills and have opportunities to participate in a variety of workplace experiences including law firms, legal centres, community-based legal organisations and services, government agencies and not-for-profit organisations. In these placements, students will be able to engage with the real world application of legal skills and principles developed in earlier units of study either through internships, clerkships and voluntary or paid legally related employment. In line with the university&#39;s Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) initiatives, the unit aims to provide students with a broad social perspective, critical thinking skills and the technical competence that employers value. Students will be advised of clinic, workplace or project opportunities on a regular basis and will be invited to apply for these opportunities online before they are required to apply for special approval to enrol in the unit.",
