Aspects of linguistic theory covered include study of sounds and sound systems (phonetics and phonology), the structure of words (morphology), and sentence patterns (syntax). Linguistic theory is presented with a focus on English, but students analyse data from a range of the world&#39;s languages. Other areas of linguistic study that are introduced include semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, and child language acquisition. Language use in everyday conversation is examined, along with issues such as language change, standardisation of language, concepts of linguistic &#39;correctness&#39;, and how different groups use language to express social and cultural identity. The unit provides a thorough grounding for students wishing to further their knowledge of linguistics in higher-level units.",
