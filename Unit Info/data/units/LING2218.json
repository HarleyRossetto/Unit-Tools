This course will introduce you to the relationship of grammar and meaning, through understanding the three functions of language: - textual function: how we organise our language into coherent text in the many different contexts in which we interact - interpersonal function: how we enact our social relationships through language - ideational function: how we use language to construe our experience of the world around us, and the world inside us. The analysis you will learn about in this unit is used in many different fields of study, including computational linguistics, translation, literary studies, child language development, political and media discourse, the language of health professionals, the language of education, etc. This is a course for people who love language, or who understand that language is important to all aspects of life.",
