    "description": "This is a unit for students of any discipline who are interested in creating texts that will be used for a professional purpose, especially writing for academic, professional and other functional purposes, or writing and editing texts that will reach a public audience. It aims to provide insights into the English language as a communicative system, and to foster a critical and informed attitude to language use in various kinds of written and multimodal texts, with clarity of communication as a central skill to be developed. The unit will also help students develop a critical eye for details of correctness and consistency, as well as an understanding of layout and structural issues across diverse media that affect the readability of a text. By developing an understanding of what makes for successful communication in the writing of others, writers can also learn to develop techniques for writing successfully themselves.",
