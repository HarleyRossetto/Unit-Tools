During this unit you will learn how to analyse spoken and written texts according to multiple theoretical frameworks of discourse analysis and develop the tools necessary to critically evaluate workplace structures and practices. The skills and knowledge gained in this unit are applicable in careers focused on solving communication problems between different cultures, or in researching and recommending communication strategies in organisations. Completing this unit will open your eyes to the way in which workplaces and other institutions propagate social inequalities, and provide you with the tools to challenge this.",
