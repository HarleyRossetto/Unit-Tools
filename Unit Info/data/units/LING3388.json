It explores theoretical models of disability, strategies to improve the communication outcomes of people with complex communication needs, and the facilitative role of communication partners. Students will engage in a work-integrated learning experience placement which may be undertaken across a range of sectors (e.g., government, not-for-profit, community-based organisations) and settings (e.g., disability policy, service planning or development, health promotion, advocacy, education, research). Students will complete a minimum of 50 hours during their placement. They will also engage with lecture and tutorial materials, which will provide theoretical knowledge and background information relevant to disadvantage and social justice, inclusion, and other social challenges. This unit will foster an understanding of the theoretical and practical considerations related to accessible and inclusive communication, highlighting strategies that facilitate successful communication for people with complex needs in a variety of real-world situations.",
