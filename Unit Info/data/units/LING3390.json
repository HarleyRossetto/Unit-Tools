    "description": "Phonology is the study of sound patterns in language - which sounds are used by different languages, how they are organized, and how sounds are represented in the mind. In this unit we will examine phonological theory, phonological organisation of speech, acquisition of phonology and issues relevant to phonological disorders. Topics to be addressed include: variation in sound structure between languages (e.g., English and Indigenous Australian languages), the phonology of tone languages (such as Chinese), sound change, and prosody (stress and rhythm in language), and morphophonology. Our focus will be on phonological data analysis (i.e. logic puzzle solving) using two approaches: Rule-Based Phonology and Optimality Theory.",
