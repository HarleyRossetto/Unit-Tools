    "description": "Forensic linguistics is a diverse, rapidly-growing field that applies linguistic knowledge and methods to the forensic context of law, language, crime investigation, and judicial procedure. This unit covers the various sub-fields and issues of forensic linguistics, such as, key theoretical and methodological approaches within the field, the work of the forensic linguist, the sub-field of forensic phonetics including speaker identification and voice comparison, authorship attribution of written texts, the linguistic investigation of plagiarism, and the linguist as an expert witness. Key outcomes of the unit are the ability to understand and describe basic concepts and theories in forensic linguistics, to demonstrate basic knowledge of a wide range of issues in forensic linguistics both in the national and international context. Students will have the opportunity to critically observe and linguistically describe relevant evidential data, as well as to analyse linguistic evidence in a scientific manner.",
