This unit introduces students to the techniques and concepts in building, annotating and interrogating a corpus. It explores the use of corpus and computation tools in a variety of contexts such as lexicography, language description, language teaching, translation and interpreting, natural language processing, sign language studies, child language development, multimodal discourse studies, and disordered discourse. The unit examines the complementarity between computers and human beings in corpus-based research. Students will be introduced to key terms for corpus development, including dialect, text, register, strata, as well as units in language. Students in this unit will receive training in, and free access to, computational tools for corpus annotation, query and analysis. The unit will be taught by staff members with expertise in diverse areas relating to corpus linguistics.",
