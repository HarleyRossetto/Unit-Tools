    "description": "This unit will focus on how people use spoken language within social interaction in everyday situations. It will examine how lexis, syntax, and prosody integrate with other semiotic resources such as gaze, gesture, the body and the surrounding environment. It will also explore particular scenes of social activity, such as conversations between friends and family, emergency calls, medical consultations, and interactions involving people with cognitive disorders. The unit will provide students with a thorough methodological grounding in the micro-analytic techniques of conversation analysis (CA) and interactional linguistics. Wherever possible, the course will take a cross-linguistic and cross-cultural perspective on social interaction. Students will develop the technical skills necessary for data collection, transcription and analysis of both audio and video recordings, as well as the management of interactional corpora.",
