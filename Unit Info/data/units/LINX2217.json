Core topics in phonetics include the articulation of vowels and consonants as well as complex articulations, airstream mechanisms and laryngeal features and their use in languages. The study of phonology will be introduced through the analysis of phonemes and allophones, syllables, word stress and intonation. The structure of sound systems and the relationship between phonetics/phonology and identity will also be examined. The unit will help students develop the skills required to carry out phonemic and phonetic transcriptions of spoken English and the opportunity to develop basic ear training in the sounds of the world&#39;s languages using the conventions of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). A common theme running throughout the unit is skill-based transcription - particularly of Australian English.",
