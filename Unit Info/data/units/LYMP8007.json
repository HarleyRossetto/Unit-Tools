In this unit you will develop an understanding and insight into how lymphoedema in children impacts an individual and their family physically, functionally, psychologically, and financially. This unit will cover comprehensive assessment, clinical reasoning, communication and management skills to treat lymphoedema in children using complex lymphoedema therapy (CLT). In this unit you will explore latest evidence based practice such as the theory of normal and abnormal lymphatic drainage pathways and patterns identified by Indocyanine Green (ICG) Lymphography for effective manual lymphatic drainage massage, compression therapy, exercise prescription, education, psychological well-being and surgical management. You will be encouraged to reflect on your own development. The unit will assist your development of the Scientist and Scholar, Clinical Practitioner and Professional graduate capabilities.",
