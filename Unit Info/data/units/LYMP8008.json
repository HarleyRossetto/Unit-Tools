    "description": "This unit is one of a series of units examining specialist skill areas of clinical practice within lymphoedema, chronic oedemas and related areas of management and clinical relevance. In this unit you will develop an understanding and insight into the management of wounds in people with lymphoedema and chronic oedemas and how this impacts an individual physically, functionally, psychologically, and financially. This unit will cover comprehensive assessment, clinical reasoning, communication and management skills to treat wounds in chronic oedemas. In this unit you will explore latest evidence based practice such as the structure and function of the integumentary system and its inter-relationship with the lymphatic system; the process of wound repair and common pathologies / presentations which disrupt the healing process; principles of patient and wound assessment, and therapeutic interventions which are aetiology focused, goal directed, measurable and evidence orientated. You will be encouraged to reflect on your own development. The unit will assist your development of the Scientist and Scholar, Clinical Practitioner and Professional graduate capabilities.",
