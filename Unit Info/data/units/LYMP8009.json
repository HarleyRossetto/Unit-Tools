    "description": "This unit is one of a series of units examining specialist skill areas of clinical practice within lymphoedema and related areas of management and clinical relevance. In this unit you will develop an understanding and insight into the management of “Wellness during cancer treatment and beyond” for individuals undergoing cancer treatment and the survivorship phase. In this unit you will develop an understanding and insight into how cancer and its treatments impact an individual physically, functionally, psychologically, and financially. This unit will cover comprehensive assessment, clinical reasoning, communication and management skills to treat individuals diagnosed with cancer. You will understand factors that influence physical function and quality of life in patients following cancer treatment such as fatigue, body image, sexuality and lymphoedema; know why and when to use assessments including pre-treatment, during treatment, and post-cancer treatment; understand theory for various treatment modalities and apply principles of chronic disease management to tailor intervention to the condition and individual goals. You will be encouraged to reflect on your own development. The unit will assist your development of the Scientist and Scholar, Clinical Practitioner and Professional graduate capabilities.",
