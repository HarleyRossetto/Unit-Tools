In calculus, the concept of a function of one variable is explored, and the notions of limit and continuity are developed. The concept of the derivative as a suitable construct to describe rates of change is defined and techniques of differential and integral calculus of functions of a real variable are developed. Some simple differential equations and their role as quantitative models for dynamic processes, are discussed. Students are also introduced to the use of computers in mathematics, and develop modelling and problem solving skills through theoretical and practical problems.",
