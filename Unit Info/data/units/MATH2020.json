    "description": "The topics covered in this unit lay the foundations for further study in modern areas of mathematics (such as partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, and mathematical biology). This unit builds on the first year single variable calculus units by extending calculus to several variables, and focuses primarily on integration techniques for complex functions and vector fields. Complex analysis is the study of complex-valued functions of complex variables. The main properties of complex functions of a single complex variable will be presented, including the important concepts of analyticity and singularity structure. This will be followed by a treatment of Cauchy&#39;s theorem and the residue theorem to evaluate contour integrals of complex functions around various curves in the complex plane. Vector calculus is the study of vector fields in two and three dimensions, and facilitates the modelling of a variety of physical phenomena, for example in fluid mechanics and electromagnetism. By introducing the gradient, divergence and curl operators, the main properties of vector fields can be analysed. A variety of integrals of vector fields over paths, surfaces and volumes will be performed, and the application of three important integral theorems of vector calculus due to Green, Stokes and Gauss to evaluate these integrals will be demonstrated.",
