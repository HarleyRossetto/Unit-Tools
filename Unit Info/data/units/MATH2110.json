Theory and application will be presented in an integrative way, emphasising the utility of mathematical methods in obtaining information and making predictions about real-world processes. The unit will focus particularly on how to interpret and derive differential equations describing (possibly coupled) physical systems that either vary in time or space. Powerful methods, and their theoretical foundations, will be introduced to analyse and solve these differential equations. Complementary numerical techniques will be used in some of the methods, preparing students for analyses of more intricate problems.",
