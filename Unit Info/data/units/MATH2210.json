The key components of this are the careful definition of the objects of interest, the development of intuition allowing consequences of these definitions to be found, and the rigorous proof of these consequences. As such, it represents an important stepping stone towards many later mathematics units, as well as being valuable in its own right. This introduction will be taught in the context of different areas of mathematics, including: analysis, which concerns limits and convergence in many contexts; algebra, which concerns the nature and properties of mathematical operations; and discrete mathematics, which involves topics such as logic and counting.",
