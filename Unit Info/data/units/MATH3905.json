Topics include the theory of ordinary differential equations and the theory of special functions. The study of ordinary differential equations encompasses linear and nonlinear systems. While linear systems are important in their own right, they provide the key framework for analysing the stability of nonlinear systems. The theory of special functions will focus on some particularly widely used classes of special functions. We will see how to derive their properties, including asymptotics, from their series and integral representations.  We will show how to employ generalised Fourier series and eigenfunction expansions utilising special functions in some important applications.",
