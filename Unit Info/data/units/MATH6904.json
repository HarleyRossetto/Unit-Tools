Its focus is on the modern application of these ideas, with a particular emphasis on applications to problems in economics, business and finance, and provides a sound mathematical basis for further study in these areas. A key focus of the unit is the development of a sound grasp of how mathematics is used to provide sophisticated modelling of complex real problems. The algebra content of the unit includes topics such as linear systems, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The study of these topics is applied to model various economic problems such as Leontief input-output models and dynamical systems used to predict long-term behaviours. The calculus content includes the development of the techniques of differentiation and integration with applications to constrained and unconstrained optimisation, including multivariable cases, and the development and application of a variety of useful approximation techniques. The techniques studied in the calculus are used to study and solve a wide variety of economic and financial problems.",
