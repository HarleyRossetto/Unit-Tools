You will study key concepts relating to drug disposition (pharmacokinetics) and how drugs act on the human body (pharmacodynamics). You will build your knowledge of chemical substances, from both outside and inside the body, and how they influence human health and disease. You will explore the mechanism of action and disposition of some commonly-used groups of drugs, as well as reasons for variability in individual drug responses. Learning activities will include interactive tutorials, online activities, and lectures.Topics covered in this unit will help you to integrate knowledge of molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry and physiology with the science of drugs.",
