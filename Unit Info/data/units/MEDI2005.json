This unit focuses on key concepts in immunology, microbiology and oncology to further develop your understanding of major human diseases. In this unit, you will learn about fundamental changes in body physiology due to injury and disease, including local and systemic responses, and molecular and cellular adaptations. You will investigate disease aetiology, pathogenesis and processes at the cellular, tissue and body system levels and approach disease from a personal, community and global perspective. You will engage in discussions of disease incidence, prevalence and control, using recent local and global health examples. Learning activities will include lectures, self-directed online learning tasks, lab-based practical, and interactive tutorials and presentations. Through this unit you will gain an understanding of health and disease processes that will be critical for a profession in medicine, public health or biomedical research. ",
