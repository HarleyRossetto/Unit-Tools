    "description": "This unit introduces integrated learning of the anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular and respiratory system. It focuses on: the mechanisms that maintain homeostasis in these coordinated systems including acid-base balance; a working knowledge of the dynamic cardiovascular and respiratory responses to physical challenges; the ability to relate cardiovascular and respiratory diseases to their underlying pathophysiological pathways. You will also critically consider scientific and medical evidence in cardiovascular and respiratory contexts to inform hypothesis generation, discussion and individual decision-making. Learning activities include instruction in anatomy and practical instruction on cardiovascular and respiratory measurements such as blood pressure, electrocardiograms, spirometry, and breath and heart sounds. This unit provides the basic knowledge of the cardiovascular and respiratory system required as a minimum for future medical studies and introduces an investigative knowledge basis for research in a biomedical or medical setting.",
