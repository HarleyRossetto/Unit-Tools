You will extend your knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the urinary system by focusing on renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, urine production and importance of kidneys in homeostasis of various body fluid compartments. You will study how various hormones interact with target cell receptors in regulating and modifying organ and cellular functions within the human body. You will discuss hormonal mechanisms and their regulatory activities on the structure and function of reproductive organs during puberty, reproductive stages and aging in humans. You will investigate how genetics and hormones interact with environmental and social influences to affect systems development and lifecycle outcomes. Key learning activities will include lectures, tutorial classes, and group presentations.",
