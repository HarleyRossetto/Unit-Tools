You will explore the function and the relationships between the four main biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) within the human body. You will gain an understanding of the fundamental structure of the cell and how this relates to function. Examples of how these processes are altered resulting in human diseases will also be provided. You will participate in practical classes which reinforce the lecture content and provide training in basic laboratory skills.",
