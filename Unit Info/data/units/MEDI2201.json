This unit focuses on the basic concepts of statistical methodologies and common statistical techniques used to analyse genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of human diseases and treatment response. In this unit, you will explore coding languages behind statistical techniques applied in the analyses of &#34;omics&#34; data and gain an understanding of how to interpret and present data generated from basic and clinical research. Learning activities will include lectures, online assessments, interactive tutorials and computer-based practicals. Through this unit you will gain biostatistics and bioinformatics skills that will be critical for a profession in medicine, public health, research or data science. ",
