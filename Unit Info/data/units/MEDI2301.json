A particular emphasis will be the discussion of the structure and function of specialised micro-compartments in neuronal cells, the generation of electrical signals in neurons, the structure, properties and function of ion channels, receptors and transporters and chemical transmission of signals at nerve cell connections. In the second part of this unit, you will focus  on how neuronal function is disrupted in disease and which technologies are available to interrogate functional aspects of the nervous system under physiological conditions and in the diseased nervous system. This will include an in depth discussion of modern experimental technologies in cellular physiology as well as the application of molecular biology techniques to manipulate and explore the function of molecules in the nervous system.",
