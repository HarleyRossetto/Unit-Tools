Key concepts in genetics, cell biology and biochemistry, which are fundamental to our understanding of human biology, diseases and medicine are examined. You will learn about signal transduction, cytoskeletal dynamics, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein metabolism, stem cells and molecular targeted therapies. You will explore cellular pathways and processes involved in cellular homeostasis, and perturbations and defects that lead to disease (e.g. cancer and neurodegenerative disorders). You will participate in practical classes that complement the lecture series and allow you to consolidate and apply conceptual elements to help shape your understanding. You will be required to use laboratory techniques including analysis of signalling cascades, and microscopy.",
