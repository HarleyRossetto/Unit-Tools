This unit focuses on providing a first hand experience of performing research and research communication. In this unit, you will become a member of several research groups under the supervision of a senior PhD candidate or post-doctoral staff member. Learning activities will include participation in research activities such as assisting in the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of data, participation in research group meetings and journal clubs, and practical experience in research communication. The immersive learning environment within the research activities will provide you with access to discipline-specific expertise, and you will be able to demonstrate the application of the theoretical knowledge obtained in your other learning activities. Through this unit you will develop skills as a researcher and research communicator.",
