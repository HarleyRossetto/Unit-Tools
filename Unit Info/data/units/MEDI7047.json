Topics covered will include: project design and planning; establishing key project contributors; launching a project; managing a project underway; troubleshooting and dealing with change; record keeping; communicating and networking; publishing; and project completion. These topics will be explored in the context of short (1 year) and long (3 year) classical academic research projects. In completing this course, you will develop a clear understanding of how to deliver a research project from start to finish. Special guest lecturers will also provide insight to research projects in different contextual settings.",
