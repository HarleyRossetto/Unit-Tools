    "description": "This unit within the Masters of Research provides learning in the processes of development and commercialisation of research ideas using the framework of device development, with concepts being applicable to the wider biomedical sphere. This unit focuses on some of the latest technologies in medical implants and provides a critical review of the clinical, biological, structural and philosophical aspects of biomedical research development. In this unit you will explore: the concept of innovation; patenting; ethical and regulatory expectations; the process of clinical trials; issues of biocompatibility and infection. The unit also uses case studies of recent biomedical research and device success and failures (including in the orthopaedic and cardiovascular fields), to contextualise learning. Learning activities will include seminars from field experts and drafting of professional documents required in biomedical development and commercialisation. Through this unit you will develop an appreciation for research, development and commercialisation that will inform your future academic research or industry-focused biomedical career.",
