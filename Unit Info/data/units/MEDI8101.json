You will have the opportunity to develop and practise consulting (communication and history taking) skills, physical examination skills and basic procedural skills within a simulated learning environment. You will be introduced to key history taking, communication and physical examination concepts. Clinical knowledge relating to several body systems and regions will be developed by studying the medical disciplines of cardiology, respiratory, gastroenterology, urology and nephrology. Clinical skills training will occur in both small and large group experiential learning activities. You will progressively develop and integrate basic consulting, communication and procedural skills with a focus on the mastery of normal systems.",
