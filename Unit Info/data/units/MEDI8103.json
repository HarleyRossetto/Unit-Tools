You will study how the disciplines of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, cell biology, pathology, microbiology, immunology and pharmacology contribute to the structure and function of normal body systems, and how these may be altered in common disease states. You will evaluate clinical case studies individually and in small groups to identify questions and learning needs and will draw upon evidence from a range of sources to articulate responses to clinical scenarios. Learning activities will include lectures, interactive practical sessions, online activities, and team based learning sessions. Through this unit you will develop the foundational medical science knowledge needed to be an effective future clinical practitioner.",
