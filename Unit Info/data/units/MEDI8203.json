You will explore evaluation of system-wide safety interventions and high-quality care; medical error; open disclosure and incident management; digital technology in healthcare, and the role of systems, people and services in the development and delivery of resilient healthcare. The unit incorporates an experiential learning component contextually focused on patient-centred health care delivered in the clinical disciplines of critical care and anaesthetics. The unit includes weekly lectures/seminars, case based learning sessions, clinical bedside tutorials, clinical simulation sessions, as well as clinical placements to ensure you are prepared for Stage 2 of the Macquarie MD. Your learning is integrated with advanced learning about research methodologies to prepare you for your Research Project which you will complete in Stage 2.   You are expected to use these learning opportunities to demonstrate significant progress toward the development of the 4 Macquarie MD Graduate Capabilities: Scientist and Scholar, Clinical Practitioner, Engaged Global Citizen and Professional, and the Entrustable Professional Activities, at a standard appropriate to  end of Stage 1 of the Macquarie MD.",
