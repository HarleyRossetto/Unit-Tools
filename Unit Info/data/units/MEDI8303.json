The units build on the research training embedded in Stage 1 of the Macquarie MD and MEDI8300: Research Project A. The research projects offered broadly focus on making a scholarly contribution to learning health systems and may include projects related to health systems development and delivery, infrastructure and resource-use in healthcare, patient safety and quality, patient and clinician experience of service delivery, patient- and professional-reported determinants of health and wellbeing, and medical education. In this unit, you will continue to work with peers involved in similar projects and their project supervisors to further implement your research plan with a focus on data collection and analyses, and drafting and refining sections of the manuscript required in MEDI8400: Research Project and Presentation.
