The research projects offered broadly focus on making a scholarly contribution to learning health systems and may include projects related to health systems development and delivery, infrastructure and resource-use in healthcare, patient safety and quality, patient and clinician experience of service delivery, patient- and professional-reported determinants of health and wellbeing, and medical education. In this unit, you will continue to work with peers involved in similar projects and your project supervisors to complete your research project and present it in the form of a written manuscript suitable for submission to a relevant journal and orally as part of a Macquarie MD research conference. The focus of this unit is interpreting and discussing the results, implications for healthcare and recommendations for future research. You will further develop and demonstrate your skills in communicating research effectively.",
