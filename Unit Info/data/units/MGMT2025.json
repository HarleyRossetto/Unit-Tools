Social enterprises endeavour to blend two strands of thinking and action: One is the social mission of serving public interest and the community, while the other includes the reliance on for-profit business practices. The aim of the course is to enable students to use theory to discern social enterprises from other types of organisations, to identify social impact solutions that are effective in both strands, understand how they work as well as analyse and recommend ways to scale them. In addition, this unit aims to promote concepts of mindfulness and reflection when analysing current issues.",
