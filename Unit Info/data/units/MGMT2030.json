Given that changes in the global business environment continue unabated, particular attention is paid to managing the increasingly diverse workforce in the context of multinational corporations that conduct business in Asia and beyond. The unit provides a setting for understanding the implications of this diversity on the management of cross-cultural dynamics in a multi-cultural business environment. Major topics include the significance of culture in international management, different approaches to ethics, communicating and negotiating across cultures, strategic planning for a global business, managing international teams, evaluating and rewarding employees worldwide, and motivating and leading across cultures.",
