The environmental pillar acknowledges the impact businesses and environmental stakeholders have on major environmental issues, such as climate change, food resources, water pollution, air pollution, energy and waste. The social pillar acknowledges the need for equity within and between generations, and within and between individuals, social groups and organisations. The economic pillar acknowledges the interactions of humans with the natural environment in using resources to create goods and services which add value to our lives. By the end of the unit, students will have a strong appreciation of the impacts of how individuals and organisations can potentially contribute to society and the environment. It encourages a fair-trading system that equitably distributes benefits and costs and further encourages students’ innovation and creativity in business planning that leads to a sustainable future.",
