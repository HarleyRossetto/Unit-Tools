Students learn how to resolve conflict and overcome impasses in various negotiation contexts including commercial, legal and labour relations in both domestic and international settings. This unit will expose students to core negotiation frameworks, strategies and tactics required to engage in effective negotiations. Students will have the opportunity to apply this theoretical learning through a series of practical negotiation simulations held in tutorials, thereby facilitating the evaluation of frameworks examined in the unit as well as providing students with the opportunity to reflect on their own capacity to negotiate effectively. ",
