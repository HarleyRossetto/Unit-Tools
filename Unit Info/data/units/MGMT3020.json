The aim of the project is to provide a solution to a problem set by an industry partner, such as a not-for-profit organisation, government agency or for-profit organisation, and to present the solution to an organisation representative at the end of the session. It is expected that students will liaise with the industry partner throughout the session to ensure they are working effectively towards the end goal. Students will gain an insight into organisations and be able to contextualise the course&#39;s learning outcomes in the final management project. Students will be assessed on a reflective journal, and on both the written and oral components of their reports.",
