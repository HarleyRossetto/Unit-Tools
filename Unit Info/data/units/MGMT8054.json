Core objectives of this unit are to enhance cultural intelligence and cross- cultural communication competence to impart an understanding of how cultural diversity affects managerial behaviour and processes. The unit prepares students to be global minded leaders with cultural intelligence, which is valued as a highly appreciated skill set by future employers. The unit utilises a range of assessments such as simulations, experiential exercises, forums, reflective tasks, case studies, presentations and group activities in order to synthesise students&#39; understanding of cross-cultural theories and their ability to apply their learning in global business settings.",
