Students will traverse the world from 1789 to 2001 looking closely at the role of revolution and the emergence of the nation-state, as well as the cost to humans and the natural world of economic growth and colonisation. Beginning with the French Revolution, the unit investigates conflict and change in the quest for equality and citizenship, telling the story of democratic aspirations in the modern world, including competing visions of modernity. It considers those excluded along with the new forms of solidarity and enmity created against the backdrop of rapid industrialisation, capitalism and environmental change. Students will build a foundational chronology of the modern world and develop skills such as critical and analytical thinking, effective communication and empathy.",
