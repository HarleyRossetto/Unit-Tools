    "description": "Few issues demand as much attention, in the military, political, and media spheres, as terrorist attacks. Each new attack unleashes a torrent of questions: how can attacks be prevented, who is responsible? Since the French Revolution terrorism has shadowed the unfolding of the modern world. Developing political and economic systems have generated violent reactions; regimes have resorted to terror as instruments of suppression and control. Terrorists have struck in the name of nationalism, religion and anarchy. In this course, we will examine terrorism historically as a form of insurgency that allowed violent extremists a low-cost route to political influence. We will address the historic evolution of terrorism since the nineteenth century, and governments&#39; efforts to counteract it. The modern world cannot be understood without exploring the nature of terrorism, and the unit will examine manifestations of terrorism in western and non-western contexts, from the Jacobins to Islamic State.",
