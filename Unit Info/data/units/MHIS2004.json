    "description": "Globalization is older than we think. In the European Middle Ages, a network of trade routes connected the Afro-Eurasian landmass, which made possible the extensive travels of Italian merchant like Marco Polo and Moroccan scholar Ibn Battuta. In the sixteenth century, these networks expanded to include the Americas, creating the first global economy. This unit traces the long history of global capitalism from its medieval origins to the data-driven on-line commerce of the twenty-first century. It explores how commerce and exchange have developed over the past millennium, considering the ideas, commodities, and political forces that have facilitated and impeded trade. It examines the social, cultural, and environmental impacts of global capitalism. This unit explains how the world economy we live today took shape and why it operates the way that it does.",
