    "description": "This unit is an intellectual and cultural history of modern war and peace making. It explores the historical emergence of the categories and practices through which modern wars have been waged and peace has been forged, in particular, we examine how ideas about race, gender and nation have underpinned modern war-making and been challenged by them. The unit examines a major conflict each week, and then explores how peace has been differently made in its wake. We begin with the French Revolutionary Wars and move through the 19th and 20th centuries, including the World Wars, the Cold War, and wars of decolonization. This will reveal when many of the ideas and practices that seem like common sense to our eyes took historical shape – such as the protection of civilians, real-time war reporting, the use of mass conscription, the widespread memorialisation of war-time loss as a nation-making project, and the use of propaganda. The story of modern war-making is often told through a focus on European nations and their conflicts with each other. However, this unit has a particular focus on how Europeans began to employ to a different set of rules and norms when waging wars with non-European peoples.  The unit asks whether conventional stories about modern military strategy, practices and restraints are challenged when we put the experiences of non-Europeans in the frame?",
