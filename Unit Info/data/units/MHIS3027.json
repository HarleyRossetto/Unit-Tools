Through a close examination of the governments of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany we will investigate how fascist regimes controlled everyday life, mobilized political support, shaped men and women&#39;s bodies, built cults of personality around their leaders, silenced the press, defeated leftist student organizations and unions, and organized repressive systems of militaristic expansion. We will also concentrate on the way that people learned to resist, survive, and even thrive under fascism through the formation of armed bands, clandestine intellectual networks, and organizations for non-violent struggle.",
