Try to keep your project manageable, by, for instance, investigating a concept or controversy through three to four primary texts. Keep your question short, too. Your paper should illustrate that you are able to locate evidence and present your findings in a clear and coherent manner.

    "description": "This advanced-studies unit introduces students to a brief history of modern historical thinking and writing. It starts with an investigation of three major and enduring strands of Western historical thought from the nineteenth century: Rankean empiricism, Marxist structuralism, and Nietzchean deconstructionism. The rest of the unit traces the intertwining ups and downs of these three traditions through the twentieth century and into the new millennium.  We look at the interplay between structuralisms and empiricisms during the early 1900s and then the returning challenge of deconstructionist—or what will be termed ‘poststructuralist’—thought by mid-century. We will study the effects of these changes especially on historical understandings of gender, class, and race. Our final weeks will look at what these different trajectories mean in our present era of ‘fake news’, and the shape of the dominant historiographical concerns of the immediate future.",
