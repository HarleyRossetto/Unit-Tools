    "description": "Was Europe indeed the &#39;dark continent&#39; suggested by historian Mark Mazower?  This unit offers a political, social, cultural and economic overview of Europe&#39;s 20th century relations with the wider world. We will trace European’s obsession with race and empire and consider how that gave rise to the First World War.  In the second part, we address the crisis of European liberalism in the face of the Great Depression, Russian communism, and the rise of fascism and Nazism.  We finish with an investigation of Europe’s postwar evolution in the context of the Cold War; the Americanisation of Western Europe and the effects of decolonisation and post-colonial immigration. Through a wide range of primary and secondary sources, class discussions, and scaffolded assessments students will develop their critical historical reading and writing skills. ",
