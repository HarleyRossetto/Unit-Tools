As well as tracing the history of the major conflicts that have engaged Australians from before white colonisation to the War on Terror, the unit will explore how the experience of war has shaped national identity. Themes will include: the idea of ANZAC and the militarisation of Australian History; the &#39;Australian way of war&#39;; gender, race and ethnicity; relationships with allies and enemies; the homefront; loss, disability and rehabilitation; and other legacies of war and commemoration. A range of sources will be used to examine these themes. An innovative feature of the unit will be an assessment structure in which students develop a history project around the influence or impact of war in their local communities. This project will link the personal and local to the broader themes explored in the unit encouraging independent and creative thinking as well as empathetic exploration of historical actors and communities.
