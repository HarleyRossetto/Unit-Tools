    "description": "Ideas about Australian identity have always been expressed and contested in popular culture. These stories of ‘us’ have also meant that some people are seen to belong, and others are excluded from the full exercise of citizenship. This unit will examine Australian history through an examination of 10 key moments when the nation and its citizens were re-imagined in films, songs, novels, poetry, advertisements, sporting contests and plays. Each week we will examine a key turning point in Australian history and the popular culture that was produced to grapple with its consequences. When and why did the bushman become a central figure in the Australian imagination? How did ‘Muriel’s Wedding’ reimagine mateship in the wake of feminist protest? In what ways did advertisements featuring Rhonda and Ketut envisage the relationship between Australia and Asia? Students who complete this unit will develop a critical understanding of the relationship between storytelling and citizenship, master a chronology of the struggles over citizenship that shaped twentieth century Australian political history, and engage widely with the cultural institutions and archives in which our national memory is stored. They will also engage in a wide variety of historical research, classroom debate, and develop an original research topic to investigate. If you have already studied some Australian history, the unit offers a fresh perspective. It will be particularly useful for students who are intending to teach Australian history in schools.",
