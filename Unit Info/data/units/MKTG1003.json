This unit develops students’ knowledge about how to understand, interpret and influence consumers’ behaviour.

Students learn about consumer needs and values, how consumers perceive products and brands, ways to measure attitudes and effect attitude change, how and why consumers decide to buy (or not buy), and the importance of culture and reference group influences. By the end of this unit, students have a much deeper and richer appreciation of how consumption not only affects our lives but also how our actions influence the way that we feel about ourselves and about one another.",
