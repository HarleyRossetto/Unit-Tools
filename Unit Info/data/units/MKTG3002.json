These challenges drive intangibility, heterogeneity, credence qualities and high similarity among competing service offerings. Because of the nature of services, service marketers have to adopt strategies to market their service offerings which are different from tangible goods. There is a growing range of touchpoints, where customers experience service marketing techniques. Therefore, services marketers require a deep understanding of issues such as service design and delivery, service quality measurement and internal marketing. The focus of this unit is on developing students’ knowledge of the specific characteristics of service offerings and service markets. Students will critically analyse and evaluate service offerings and service delivery processes.
