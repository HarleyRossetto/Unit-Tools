    "description": "The digital revolution has created an enormous volume of data on markets, customers and the business environment which marketers have sought to incorporate into their strategic decision-making. Yet, raw data on its own adds very little to the strategic decision process. Marketers need to understand how to organise and analyse available data to generate actionable insights. Such insights are useful in anticipating future consumer needs, identifying trends, forecasting market conditions, gauging competition and making informed predictions about an ever-changing environment. Marketers then utilise these insights to build compelling narratives and to provide actionable recommendations for important marketing decisions.<br />In this unit students will investigate appropriate data, data sources and analytic techniques required to generate input for key marketing decisions regarding markets and customers. Students will assess suitable data analysis techniques and evaluate generated output to develop insights and determine potential marketing decision options. Additionally, students will appraise these key options by estimating likely impacts and integrating these impacts with practical organisational issues.",
