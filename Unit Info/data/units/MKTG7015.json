You are to identify gaps or limitations in previous research, and synthesize new knowledge into a written literature review. For this assessment task, you are required to discuss literature review within its appropriate and wider context, consider the theoretical underpinnings of the journal articles reviewed (and not just the results), present a coherent and structured discussion of the literature including both depth and breadth of analysis, use the review to identify gaps or limitations in prior research, and show original thought to constructively criticise existing literature. Students must support their discussion with clear evidence (e.g., high quality articles accessed from top ranking journals) that support, explain and critique the consumer behaviour theory / concept chosen.<br />Length: 2000 words±10%",
