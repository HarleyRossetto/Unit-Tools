    "description": "Professional service firms (PSFs) work in a very competitive and dynamic environment and face both increasing opportunities and challenges. PSFs have unique characteristics that set them apart from other service firms. PSFs are knowledge intensive service firms delivering highly customised service across a range of sectors such as consultancy, engineering, and IT services. These characteristics justify consideration of whether traditional marketing management concepts and models need to be adapted to better account for service-dominant economies and for the successful marketing of business relationships in PSFs. This unit will develop students&#39; knowledge of how to manage and market PSFs&#39; services. The unit will develop students&#39; knowledge and skills about how to create and develop relationships with business customers, provide high quality customised service solutions to business customers, and plan to recruit and retain highly qualified professionals.",
