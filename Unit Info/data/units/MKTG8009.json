    "description": "With increasing market dynamism, the effective development and management of marketing supply chains is becoming an invaluable competitive advantage. A marketing supply chain is a system of organisations, people, activities, information and resources involved in moving a product or service from a supplier to its customers at the right place, time and cost. This unit advances students learning of the principles, concepts and approaches applied in the management of marketing supply chains. The focus of this unit is on synthesising students&#39; knowledge of the management of procurement processes, managing effective relationships among people in the supply chains, and the flow of information and materials in the supply chains so as to build and sustain a competitive process. The unit helps students to identify how the strategic management of an organisation&#39;s marketing supply chain can sustain competitiveness in a highly dynamic environment.",
