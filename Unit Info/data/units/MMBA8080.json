At least 15 minutes should be devoted to a question and answer session. Each group member is expected to participate in the Q &amp; A. Whilst this presentation task is done in a group environment, each student will be graded on their individual contributions. This part of the task contributes half of the total available marks. Part two requires each group to submit a written summary of up to 2,500 words of their research and presentation after taking into consideration issues and/or criticisms raised in the class discussion.",

What is important about a philosophical perspective is not what it explains, but what it assumes. Three assumptions ground the unit: a) managing is essentially a philosophical activity because human existence is interpreted through diverse perspectives; b) management training needs to be combined with management education. To train is to drill and subordinate individuals to routines, standards and practices. To educate is to liberate a person’s intellectual, moral and aesthetic powers. c) managers and leaders need to have the critical skills to debate, reflect, and engage in dialogue across different functional disciplines, stakeholders and cultures in organisational contexts.",
