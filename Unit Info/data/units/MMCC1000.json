This unit introduces critical concepts to analyse visual texts, technologies, and communication practices. From film, television, photography and advertising, to social media applications and sites, we look at the ways media and communication shape (and are shaped by) our social worlds, our bodies and identities, changing technologies and online communities. We focus on visual communication and normalising practices, contemporary politics, events, embodiment, digital cultures, globalisation and social networking. Within these frameworks, we explore the (re)production, performance and use of identity and subjectivity, and canvass notions of genre, discourse, power and textuality through the application and testing of methods of visual analysis. Finally, we place visual communication within the personal, the sensory and the everyday through the practical exploration of social media use.",
