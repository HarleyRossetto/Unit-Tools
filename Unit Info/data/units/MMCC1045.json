In this unit students are introduced to the universal role of rhythm as a means of measuring and managing time, and then explore how creative musical ideas are applied in practice. Students also create original musical projects, collaborate and perform elements of musical repertoire, and learn to conceptualise and analyse structural features of musical works. This unit encourages students to extend theoretical and practical knowledge of creativity into their own musical practice, including singing and production, or their musical instrument of choice, or into other interdisciplinary creative forms.
