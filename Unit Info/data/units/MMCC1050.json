    "description": "This unit focuses on ways to think about and study stories. Students study storytelling in multimodal contexts such as journalism, films, video clips, images, songs, short fiction, comics, audio, podcasts, testimony, broadcast, artworks, and online content. The unit equips students with the analytical skills to think critically about what shapes storytelling in our contemporary media landscape. The narratives in our media inform who we are and our place in the world. They provide us with information; but more importantly they give form to our lives in enabling and dangerous ways. Students therefore learn the histories, techniques and structures of narrative. We consider the ways in which certain stories define and locate their potential audience; and how stories construct, reveal and hide meaning to persuade their audiences. The unit is an important introduction to how to construct a narrative in multimodal forms, and will be useful for any career option.",
