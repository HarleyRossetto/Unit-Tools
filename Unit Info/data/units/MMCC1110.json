    "description": "At work and in our personal lives we navigate complex, ever-changing digital technologies, each with their own affordances, cultural norms, and potential hazards. This unit introduces students to key ideas and contemporary debates in digital media studies. We pose questions about the history of technological change, how we create and consume digital media, what happens to our online information, and the promises and risks related to new technologies. Through class discussions, key texts, multimedia, and lecture content, students have the opportunity to engage with topics such as online identity, artificial intelligence, digital labour, participatory culture, activism, digital games, and surveillance. Through these prisms, students will develop capacities to critically assess how technologies are shaped and how they shape us. Additionally, students will undertake self-directed research involving hands-on digital media production. The unit explores innovative digital media forms and practices.",
