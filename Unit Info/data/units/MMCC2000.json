Students will deconstruct some of the most popular and critically regarded contemporary songs and compositions in order to better understand and facilitate their own creative techniques. Song and compositional structures will be a unit focus and topics will include lyrical, melodic, rhythmic, chordal, harmonic and musical components. In doing so, it will contribute to, and provide links between, existing Music units in music production, voice, guitar, music business, and popular music. Recording as a compositional tool, loop stations and aspects of music production may enable students to work with various music technologies as relevant to their creative practice. In the context of music business, the authorship and ownership of original material through publishing, performance and recording will be discussed.",
