        "description": "Based on research and inspired by strong ideas, you will develop a pitch for a film of under 5 minutes in length. You may choose to pitch: a documentary; an experimental film; or a narrative, fiction film. The film could be in any genre. The film must have minimal dialogue (no more than 5 lines) with the exception of film essays and documentaries (which can include longer interviews and voice-over). The film MUST be made in black and white. The film MUST address a significant social, political, or cultural issue (e.g, anxiety among students) in a direct or indirect way. If you would like your screen idea to come to life on screen it must be feasible. For this assessment students need to submit: 1. a digital presentation of the pitch. 2. a written document of around 750 words addressing the following: a. A working title. b. 1-sentence description of the film. c. Familiarity with the form and genre. d. A short synopsis of the film. e. What is the social issue that you are exploring in your film? e. Key motif. f. Additionally thoughts on other relevant elements such as shooting style, performance, production design, the colour-palette, etc.",
