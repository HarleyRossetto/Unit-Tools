For example, why do we, or would we, decide to have an affair or a one night stand? Why do we decide to have kids, or not? Why do we decide to work, or be educated? Why do we decide it is important to prolong human life, or not (euthanasia)? Why do we choose to eat or not eat animals? Selecting from topics such as health, environment, science, to adultery, marriage, abortion, euthanasia, religion, war, sport, and work, this unit will draw on a number of key thinkers, ethical and practical approaches, and media representations, to debate how and why we make the decisions we do, why we think some decisions are more important than others, and how our decisions are influenced by media and politicians, religion and society, family and friends.",
