Drawing on perspectives from media and cultural studies, communication studies, disability studies, critical health studies and science and technology studies, we ask how our own embodied experiences of health or ill health are shaped by media and culture, as well as wider biomedical and political institutions. We will focus particularly on the way health is imagined in broadcast and online media, including public health campaigns, popular science communication, news and current affairs, commercial advertising, popular entertainment television genres and self-monitoring apps. Contemporary debates such as those around smoking, obesity, drinking, sexual health and mental illness will be analysed and discussed and we will explore how categories of &#39;health&#39; and &#39;illness&#39; play out in ethical and political decision making. How are ideas about &#39;normal&#39; or &#39;pathological&#39; bodies and identities tied into concepts of &#39;health&#39;? And how does the idea that &#39;wellness&#39; is an individual&#39;s responsibility underpin public policy and peoples&#39; ways of understanding and managing their own bodies?",
