    "description": "In this unit students apply music industry theory to a range of real life situations. They create and market an artist&#39;s image, organise and promote a live gig, and learn how to plot a musician&#39;s career path. This course provides a holistic outline of the music industry: it considers all five income stream groups (record sales, live performance, song publishing, merchandise and sponsorship) in relation to artists&#39; and industry practitioners&#39; careers. The artist manager is the only other individual, besides the artist, who gets to see and touch all the jigsaw puzzle pieces that fit together to create the artist&#39;s career. This course therefore focuses on artist management in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the different facets that constitute the industry.",
