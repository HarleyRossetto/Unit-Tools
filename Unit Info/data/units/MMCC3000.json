Moving beyond desktop music production and software tools, students learn about the recording studio environment by using studio hardware and production tools. Students produce original creative music works using a fully-equipped music studio, gaining practical studio experience. Further aspects of this course include the establishment of critical listening skills, research of specific musical genres, and the development of an understanding of audio production concepts in a recording studio environment. Students obtain a knowledge base which may be applied to many areas of music production in real-world contexts, and create recordings that incorporate a practical and theoretical understanding of contemporary music production.",
