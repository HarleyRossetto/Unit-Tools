As such, it links the skills, knowledge and insights students have gained from various Media courses to relevant future pathways. Questions that this unit will ask include: how are media debates ethically conceived and represented? What are the ethical implications of un-sourced media narratives? How does the media therefore construct and shape culture, society and individuals? The unit will draw on a number of media theories, ethical and practical approaches, as well as previous course content and knowledge to debate the role of the media in shaping public opinion, and ethical decision-making around various narratives, including news stories, and social perceptions. In other words, how are we influenced by media in relation to ethical decision-making more generally?",
