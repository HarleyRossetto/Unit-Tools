Building upon new media theory and game studies&#39; approaches students will critically engage with the cultural, political, artistic, and technological dimensions of this increasingly important media form. This course explores the crucial theoretical issues in gaming, from rules and interactive narrative, to gender and power. Students will learn to analyse video games through a range of conceptual approaches that recognize the specificities of this form while acknowledging games as part of the broader media-scape. The unit is designed to offer those interested in designing, writing, analyzing, writing about, or even just playing video games, a deeper understanding of the role and context of video game play in contemporary culture. It will provide students with the conceptual frameworks needed to theorize the past, present, and future of this complex and crucial medium.",
