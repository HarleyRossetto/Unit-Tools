It offers a brief history of the emergence of forensic media, tracking the development of the police mug shot, forensic photography and the establishment of criminal archives. It then examines the broad spectrum of contemporary technologies that are shaping the field of forensic media, including: forensic typical body charts, biometrics and other border technologies, satellite imaging, CCTV, interoperable networks and megadata surveillance, drones, Twitter, Instagram, thermal imaging and emergent technologies. Forensic technologies have now become foundational for news organisations in order for them to illustrate and evidence their news stories - from mobile phone apps such as Metadata news feed to record and communicate secretive drone strikes to satellite imaging to evidence unfolding humanitarian crises. This unit places forensic media within news media contexts in order to address the ethical, geopolitical and social questions that the use of such media raises.",
