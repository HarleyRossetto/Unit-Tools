The creative work may be a song, instrumental composition or soundscape. The length of the musical work will depend on your individual project. A written reflection on process that details the sounds, form/structure of the work, and the factors that influenced the creation of the work needs to be submitted. \n\n2. The analysis should begin with a detailed description of the sounds as well as the form/structure of the work. Thereafter, the analysis should explore the historical, creative, technological, and/or social factors that influenced the creation of the work/event. \n\nRefer to iLearn for further information.",

It examines key movements, innovations, and major ideas that have shaped, and continue to shape, the evolution of musical forms and practices. The unit also addresses contemporary approaches to musical hybridity and sound production as related to contemporary performance practice in a globalized environment. This includes approaches to songwriting and digital production. In particular, the unit will explore examples of musical creativity such as progressive rock, jazz, psychedelic music, punk/post-punk, ambient, mash-up, minimal techno and electronics, glitch and noise, post-rock and post-classical music. Students will gain a current and historical overview of the dynamic pattern of innovative ideas in music across writing, performance and production.",
