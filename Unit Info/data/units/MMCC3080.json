    "description": "In this unit students work with contemporary production platforms. The unit caters to students in multimedia, screen and music production wishing to create sound design and audio-rich podcasting projects. The unit provides students the opportunity to create and complete a major project in radio (either a documentary feature, performance, experimental or music-sound theatre work) by working to construct their own creative works or soundtracks, or by realising new forms through interdisciplinary collaboration. Importantly, this unit provides students with experience in the  functions of sound in audio-visual media and other performance forms, and enables a sophisticated understanding of the powerfully affecting sonic dimension of various media. Lectures extend and challenge students&#39; knowledge of auditory culture and its formal developments; advanced production sessions build sophisticated levels of competency using a range of state-of-the-art facilities and equipment.",
