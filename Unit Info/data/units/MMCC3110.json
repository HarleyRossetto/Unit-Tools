Key readings are drawn from a number of platforms – books, feature articles, blogs, graphic novels, indie publishing – to exemplify some of the more dynamic and engaging recent trends in creative nonfiction writing. We focus in particular on new and novel ways of approaching the past – historical events, family sagas, crimes, eccentric and little known phenomena – and on new modes of writing about science, sport, technology and social change. Students are guided to find and develop their own original stories, and produce pieces of quality writing, suitable for print or broadcast. ",
