    "description": "This unit is intended to develop foundational knowledge and skills in the field of media communications and is designed for students from a range of backgrounds and skill levels. The unit introduces students to key theories and contemporary debates that animate the study of digital media and communications. We pose questions about the history of technological change, how we create and consume digital media, what happens to our online information, and the promises and risks related to new technologies. In class discussions, key texts, multimedia, and lecture content, students have the opportunity to engage with topics at the leading-edge of media studies. Students will develop capacities to analyse and critically assess how technologies are shaped and how they shape us. Additionally, students will undertake self-directed research involving hands-on digital media production. The unit provides a critical foundation for students pursuing postgraduate research in the area of media and communications with an emphasis on innovative digital media forms and practices.",
