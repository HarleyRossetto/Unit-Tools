        "description": "Task: \n\nDrawing on the ideas that have been investigated through the course of this semester, you will produce an original project that engages with at least one key concept or debate from the unit readings/lectures. When we say “engages with,” we don’t necessarily mean “agrees with.” In your project, you can feel free to question, critique, reframe, expand on, or otherwise interact with ideas from class.  \n\nFormat:\n\nYour project can take any form you wish: it could be an essay; a short story; a short video; a curated photo series; a staged prank or social experiment of some sort, etc.** We’ll discuss ideal lengths for different formats during tutorials.  Regardless of format, you’ll need to ask yourself, questions like: \n\n- As a student in a class called Representing Realities, am I interested in creating a project that deals in facts, in fictions, or in a mix of these? Why?\n\n- Do I want readers/viewers to perceive my display of reality in this project as reliable, unreliable, hard to verify, or a mix of these? Why?\n\n- Do I want readers/viewers to experience my narration of reality as objective, omniscient, personally invested/affected, or something else? Why?\n\n**Please be advised that the range of format options above has been provided to allow students across all areas of the department to exercise their existing creative strengths. However, this is NOT a production class, and we do not teach production-oriented skills. If you are in doubt about format, we urge you to choose the essay approach, as it is one most students have encountered in the past.\n\nRefer to iLearn for further information.",
