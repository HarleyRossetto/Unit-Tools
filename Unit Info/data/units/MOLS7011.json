Biomolecular sciences spans the study of individual molecular structures and biochemical reactions to also encompass the &#39;omics&#39; sciences of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and glycomics. These sciences all generate large and complex datasets that require specialized software and methods to assemble and analyse. The analyses are challenging, as they not only require a good knowledge of biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell and developmental biology, but also an understanding of limitations of both the software and the data quality. This unit will provided a background to the data acquisition methods, quality control of the datasets, and analysis methods within a number of these areas. Most importantly it will provide hands-on experience in the analysis of real large-scale datasets and the correct use of appropriate analysis tools.",
