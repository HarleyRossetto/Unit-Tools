This unit will provide students with the conceptual framework of systematic molecular design in order to build new componentry and biological systems. The unit will be taught extensively through the primary literature and will provide students with hands on experience in cutting edge tools required to design and synthesize biological parts. Exemplars of current applications including generation of biofuels, microbial synthesis of pharmaceuticals, and design of biosensors to detect infection and environmental waste will be examined. This unit will also focus on the ethical, legal and societal issues surrounding synthetic biology.",
