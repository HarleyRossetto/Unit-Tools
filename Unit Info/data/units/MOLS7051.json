It will connect the underpinning physical chemistry topics (e.g., spectroscopy, quantum chemistry, kinetics) to the application methods employed by analytical chemistry. Topics to be covered will be determined by negotiation between staff and students. Exemplars of current applications of physical and analytical chemistry include the global impacts of, for instance, greenhouse gas detection and quantification, distribution of persistent organic pollutants, and the determination of the structures of novel nanomaterials.",
