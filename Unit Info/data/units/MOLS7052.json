    "description": "This unit comprises study of an advanced topic in chemistry and biomolecular sciences. The area studied each year is tailored to the current student cohort. Emphasis is put on both the understanding of advanced concepts as well as their application in problem-solving and/or research environments. Chemical biology is the science of small molecules in the context of living systems. This course focuses on current topics in chemical biology, particularly experiments in which small molecules are used to probe or control biological systems in novel ways or manipulate and understand biological systems. As the goal of the course is to familiarise students with innovative recent experimental approaches and to stimulate them to explore the boundaries of chemistry and biology, the unit will be taught extensively through the primary literature. Topics may include but are not limited to: In vitro display technologies, chemical proteomics, primary and secondary metabolism, chemical tools in mammalian systems, natural products and drug discovery.",
