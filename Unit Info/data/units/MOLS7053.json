    "description": "This unit comprises study of an advanced topic in chemistry and biomolecular sciences. The area studied each year is tailored to the current student cohort. Emphasis is put on both the understanding of advanced concepts as well as their application in problem-solving and/or research environments. This unit provides the students with advanced and contemporary knowledge in the broad discipline of organic chemistry and focuses on topics that describe modern theories and practices in this area. As the control of change forms the heart of chemistry, this unit will examine the principles of change in more complex systems and in quantitative terms that are appropriate to graduate level studies. The molecular insight developed in this course will prepare students for creative research in basic and applied organic chemistry or interface fields. Topics may include but are not limited to: advanced structural chemistry and methods; mechanistic models and characterisation; advanced synthesis and catalysis; biomimetic processes and materials; molecular assemblies; reactive intermediates; and properties.",
