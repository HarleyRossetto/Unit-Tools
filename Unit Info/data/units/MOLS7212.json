We may adjust that schedule depending on class numbers. Participation in all other group’s topics contributes to your final mark. Perform your own peer-review of your chosen paper - tell us whether you think this paper should have been published and why. Look up other relevant literature so you can discuss your chosen paper in context rather than in isolation. The presentationcan be submitted as a video presentation uploaded in advance to youtube. It must include figures, graphics, text (and some footage of the presenter). ",

Topics include: a detailed study of advanced techniques, instrumentation and protein identification software in mass spectrometry; two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis; label-free and isotope-labelling quantitation in proteomics; application of different types of peptide- and protein-based shotgun proteomics approaches; multiplexed reaction monitoring: data independent acquisition; and characterisation of protein post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and glycosylation.
