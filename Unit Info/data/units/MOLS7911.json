Students will select a portfolio of techniques across chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, genomics or microbiology, according to their discipline background and interest. Independent skills and technical competency in a minimum of three contemporary methodologies or instrumentation types will be developed through intensive practical sessions with Macquarie researchers.  This is a skills-focused unit designed to practically enrich methods encountered from a more theoretical standpoint in other units.",
