It encompasses pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry, nuclear science, pharmacology, biology and radiation safety. It is particularly relevant to drug design and the radiolabelling of drugs and biological macromolecules for use in non-invasive imaging. The unit also contains a component of laboratory management, quality assurance and regulatory affairs associated with both pharmaceutical production, and radiation safety. With access to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the National Medical Cyclotron, and departments of nuclear medicine in hospitals, it will provide highly relevant contemporary and hands-on training for students.",
