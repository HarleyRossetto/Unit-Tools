    "description": "This unit provides an introduction to synthetic biology and hands-on practise in the analysis of large datasets gathered when working in the broad field of biomolecular sciences. Biomolecular sciences spans the study of individual molecular structures and biochemical reactions to also encompass the &#39;omics&#39; sciences of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and glycomics. These sciences all generate large and complex datasets that require specialised software and methods to assemble and analyse. The analyses are challenging, as they not only require a good knowledge of biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell and developmental biology, but also an understanding of limitations of both the software and the data quality. The lectures on synthetic biology start with a brief overview of the field before delving into more challenging yet exciting concepts. You will learn about current techniques and approaches used in synthetic biology and design a molecular switch using these principles. The lectures also discuss applications, limitations and future potential of synthetic biology to produce new solutions to global challenges.",
