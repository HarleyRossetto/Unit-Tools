Your supervisor has agreed to complete this evaluation as part of their agreement to host your internship or project.  You will need to provide your supervisor with a copy of the placement evaluation form, giving your supervisor enough time to complete their evaluation.  \nDuring your internship or project your supervisor will assess your performance using the supervisor’s placement evaluation marking guide included in the placement evaluation form. If your performance is rated unsatisfactory at any time during your internship or project, you will be invited to a meeting to discuss your performance. You may be given an opportunity to improve your performance or the internship or project may be discontinued.  In this case, you may be required to complete the remainder of your placement hours within the Macquarie Business School or PACE. In these cases, the PACE team will identify a project, an appropriate supervisor and specify the number of hours required to meet the learning outcomes of this unit.\nIf your supervisor gives a fail for your placement evaluation at the end of session, penalties may be applied to Task 3. \nIn the critical reflection you will critically reflect on your progress towards achieving learning objectives identified in Task 1, with reference to your internship or project experience and assigned readings, incorporating any feedback from your supervisor and/or feedback on Task 1.\n",
