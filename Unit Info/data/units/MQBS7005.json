It is designed for students who are undertaking, or who are seeking to undertake, a major higher degree research based project or thesis. Students will explore the purpose of research and its role within the broader community. Topics also include the philosophical aspects of the scientific process and knowledge paradigms, developing a necessary researcher’s mindset, as well as various protocols associated with research conduct and academic writing. Students will acquire a deeper understanding of various elements of the research project/thesis, including effective and comprehensive literature reviews, approaches to research and research methodology, as well as how to make sense of, and report on, data results. Students will learn to discuss and contextualise research results with regard to what has been found in previous literature and their implications for the theoretical foundations of their chosen study. Finally, students will be guided through various aspects of the peer-review process including the submission of manuscripts to conferences and journals as well as addressing reviewer feedback.",
