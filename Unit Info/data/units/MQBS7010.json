Through this process you will become familiar with the theory and research applying that specific theory as you undertake an analysis and evaluation of the research (theory/paper and published work using the theory). The report will assess your ability to analyse the topic and relevant research papers, identify limitations and formulate suggestions about further research opportunities, marshal your thoughts and ideas and communicate them via the Department&#39;s chosen submission approach (e.g. weekly/fortnightly review reports on the seminar papers that are being presented in the Department seminar series and presentations on the content of selected ground-breaking high-impact articles, or 2500 words for written report and 30 minutes for the presentation). You will be assessed on the identification and evaluation of relevant theory and concepts, and research on the selected/nominated topic; the depth of your research and critical analysis, and the quality of your communication to your audience.",
