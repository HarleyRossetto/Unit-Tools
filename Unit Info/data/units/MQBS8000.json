Through the unit&#39;s real world experience opportunities and engagement in business challenges requiring cross-disciplinary insights and knowledge, students are not only required to develop their reflective and integrative thinking but also engage in the development of their future-focused, strategic thinking. Students are exposed to contemporaneous business intelligence devised to give them the opportunity to consider practical implications of business issues and challenges and to investigate strategic business matters within the context of a business environment.
