It details how these individual components work, and how they are integrated into simple systems. This process empowers students to be engineers and makers who see how instrumentation and automation surround us and enable modern life. The unit builds on foundations in electricity, mechanics, and programming and asks participants to learn how sensors and actuators work (physics), how they interact (signals), and how they behave (system response). The unit is essential for further study in the field of mechatronic engineering, where the simple systems examined and experimented with here are built into complex automated electromechanical machines.",
