The unit aims to address the application of fundamental principles and methods at an advanced level in the context of standards and practices, modelling, analysis, design and practical implementation. The unit also develops skills in the critical evaluation of information, software and sources of error, and experimental methods. Learning will be achieved using case studies, laboratories, presentations, group work and/or traditional lecture format. The specific topics will focus on current advances in the area such as microcontrollers, MEMs, nanotechnologies, control systems, sensors and actuators and electro-mechanical interfacing.",
