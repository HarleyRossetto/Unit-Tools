This unit will integrate your understanding of mechanics with functional anatomy through the study of biomechanics of human locomotion (in two dimensions) and gross motor functions through the use of kinematics, kinetics, muscle function, work, and power. The mechanics of tissues in the musculoskeletal system will also be introduced and discussed in the context of injuries and exercise prescription. The basis of methods for assessing movement, both quantitative and qualitative, will also be introduced enabling basic practical analysis of common movements to be performed. Learning activities include lectures and hands-on laboratories.",
