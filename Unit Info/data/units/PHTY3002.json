The unit integrates your prior study of anatomy, biomechanics, physiology, neuroscience, behavioural sciences, and psychology as it pertains to human movement. The unit explores the classification of motor skills, the neuromotor processes that underpin motor performance, and features of the learning environment that can be manipulated to promote motor learning in a coaching and/or rehabilitation context. The aim of the unit is to provide a behavioural and physiological understanding of the acquisition and execution of skilled motor actions and how to train and/or retrain motor actions.  You will apply your learning through a group project in which you train a healthy person to learn or improve a motor skill. Through this unit you will learn how to instruct and provide feedback as appropriate for a potential future career as a practitioner/clinician.",
