Specifically, students will learn how to formulate clinical questions about diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and locate and critically appraise relevant high-quality evidence to answer those questions. This unit provides an evidence-based framework for concurrent and future units of study and is embedded in the curriculum to enhance life-long learning skills. By integration with a clinical component, students will develop foundational skills in how to implement evidence-based health care in clinical practice.",
