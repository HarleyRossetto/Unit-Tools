    "description": "This unit introduces the principles, theory and application of electromagnetism. We first develop the theory of electromagnetism, which describes the properties and behaviour of electric and magnetic fields and their interaction with charged matter. Maxwell&#39;s four laws of electromagnetism are revisited, in the powerful language of vector calculus. We explore their power for understanding phenomena in electrostatics, magnetostatics and electrodynamics. We then address the thermodynamic principles which guide our understanding of the physical world: the conservation of energy and the increase in entropy. We motivate the introduction of macroscopic state functions such as temperature, pressure, and volume to characterise the state of a system, and connect them with the concept of the equation of state, including the case of ideal and Van der Waals gases. The formulation of the Zeroth through the Third Laws of Thermodynamics are used to understand the concepts of reversible and irreversible engines as exemplars of all thermodynamic systems. Finally, we make a connection between entropy and information theory. Advanced techniques of experimental physics including indirect measurement of microscopic quantities are covered in guided laboratory sessions, as are data analysis techniques and report writing.",
