    "description": "This unit provides a survey of the physics of the very small including atoms, the nucleus and the fundamental particles of the standard model, and their description in terms of quantum mechanics – the most successful and accurate theory in modern physics. As well as being the theory that underlies most of modern physics, it also provides a viewpoint about the nature of the physical world that is completely at odds with our everyday intuition. We develop the structure of quantum mechanics in terms of a set of basic principles and their expression in the mathematical language of vector spaces and operators and show how this picture encompasses the wave function picture we have met previously. We apply these principles and the quantum mechanics of angular momentum to discover the basic properties of the hydrogen atom and explain the general form of the periodic table and the nature of atomic spectra. Turning to the sub-atomic domain, we explore the basic structure of the nucleus, the nature of radioactivity and explain the phenomena of nuclear fission and fusion. Finally, we describe the particles and interactions which compose the current understanding of the standard model of particle physics and explain their division into different families on the basis of mass and spin.",
