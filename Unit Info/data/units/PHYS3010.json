    "description": "This course continues our development of the classical theory of electromagnetism, the first example of a unified theory in physics and the origin of the concept of fields. We apply Maxwell’s equations to derive a full dynamical description of electromagnetism in free space with an emphasis on the generation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. We use the concepts of interference and diffraction to determine how light propagates through and interacts with optical systems. Interference underpins practical devices such as the Fabry-Perot interferometer or multilayer dielectric filters while diffraction is critical for analysing beam propagation and image formation. Modern optical techniques are studied in the regular laboratory program that also reinforces the use of advanced data analysis and report writing techniques and thus provides a strong foundation for future research project work.",
