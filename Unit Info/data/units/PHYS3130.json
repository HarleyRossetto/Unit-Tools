    "description": "This unit deals with the fascinating world of quantum physics, providing a modern introduction to quantum mechanics and its applications. As well as being the theory that underlies most of modern physics, it also provides a viewpoint about the nature of the physical world that is completely at odds with our everyday intuition. The material covered here provides an introduction to the basic physical principles of quantum mechanics and the mathematical language that is needed to describe the new physics. We will study the three most important exactly-solvable models in quantum theory: the potential well, harmonic oscillator, and hydrogen atom. The quantum mechanics of angular momentum is also introduced and explored. These principles are developed further in the context of atomic physics in the second half of the unit, demonstrating the origin of the unique energy-level diagrams for each atom in the periodic table, consequently the unique spectrum of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation that can be emitted and/or absorbed. Physics of multi-electron systems, origins of the periodic properties of the elements, and interactions with electromagnetic fields are explored, as well as current topics like laser manipulation of atoms, optical lattices, and cold atomic gases.",
