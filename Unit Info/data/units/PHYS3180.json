    "description": "This unit introduces basic thermodynamic principles and connects them with the physical laws and the statistical nature of the microscopic world governing the behaviour of the matter around us. We start out with the concept of temperature and investigate the emergence of the Boltzmann factor in the canonical ensemble. We then proceed with the kinetic theory of gases and discuss transport properties and thermal diffusion. The first and second law of thermodynamics form the foundation for understanding the basic working principles of thermodynamic engines. We next introduce three key pillars of statistical physics: the equipartition theorem, partition functions and the influence of distinguishability on the counting statistics of particles. This sets us up for a discussion of basic solid-state phenomena as they were known in early 20th century, including Debye theory of the heat capacity of solids, the basics of Drude transport theory and Sommerfeld’s electron model.",
