The aim is to develop effective problem solving strategies, and where possible, the examples will be taken from the physical sciences. In the first topic the primary focus is on ordinary differential equations covering topics from first order equations and how to classify and solve them, through to higher order equations and more general techniques such as reduction of order, Laplace transforms, Green functions and series solutions. The second topic covers discrete groups and continuous Lie groups and Lie algebras. Group representations are introduced with the examples from Abelian and non-Abelian groups. Irreducible representations, unitary representations, Shur&#39;s Lemma, and orthogonality relations are covered in the context of discrete groups. Compact and non-compact Lie groups and their generating Lie algebras are presented with several examples making the connection between symmetries and conservation laws, e.g. space-time symmetries and the Poincare group.",
