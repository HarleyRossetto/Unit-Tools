We derive the hierarchy of nonlinear effects, such as simple frequency doubling and mixing and enhancement using periodic materials; the Kerr effect and its applications in ultrafast lasers; Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering and their relevance to all-optical switching; and high-harmonic generation for generating XUV light and attosecond pulses. Advanced topics may include using the nonlinear Schrodinger equation to investigate nonlinear effects in fibres, such as soliton formation, super continuum generation.<br />\n<br />\nWe establish how to use light-matter interactions to detect and study atoms and molecules. We determine the form of their excitation spectra, the factors that determine the shape and width of the spectral features, and how to measure them using infrared to ultraviolet excitation wavelengths. We will study more complex techniques that may include enhancements such as cavity ring down and Doppler-free methods; Raman spectroscopy and techniques such as CARS; and enhancement of Raman scattering using nanostructures and the quest for single molecule detection.",
