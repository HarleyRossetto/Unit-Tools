    "description": "This unit introduces students to the growing field of quantum information science and technology. A general formalism is introduced involving the concept of Hilbert space, states represented by density matrices, open systems evolution via operator sum decompositions, and generalised measurement theory. Much of the unit covers the physics and quantum information aspects of leading physical implementations for a quantum engineered device, including: atomic, (neutral and trapped ion), photonic, superconducting and semiconductor devices. There is a laboratory component based on photonic systems with experiments on quantum correlations in single photons, tests of quantum nonlocality, and generation of entangled photons.",
