    "description": "This unit teaches fundamentals and emerging topics in engineered quantum materials. As originally envisioned by Feynman, quantum simulation is a process where one set of controllable quantum systems can be made to simulate a complex quantum system that is too hard to model classically. In this unit we will explain how quantum simulators work to mimic natural and unnatural, or synthetic, materials. Theoretical skills taught will be standard techniques from condensed matter, as well as tools used in quantum information. You will learn how a quantum system can be programmed to simulate another either via an analogue simulation using an engineered Hamiltonian, or via a digital gate-based quantum simulation. We will cover the physics of experimental quantum simulation architectures including trapped ions and neutral atoms, and colour centres in diamond. Applications of synthetic quantum matter for quantum error correction and sensing will be covered. To better understand the physics of many body quantum systems you will learn numerical techniques including quantum simulation code and approximation methods known as tensor networks in order to simulate ground states and dynamics of many body quantum systems.",
