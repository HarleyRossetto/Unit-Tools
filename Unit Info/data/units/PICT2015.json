Attention will be given to case studies looking at various religious, political, and far-right and far-left ideological terrorist and violent extremist organisations. By the end of this unit, students will gain an understanding of the dynamics that underpin twenty-first century terrorism and violent extremism, as well as evaluate both hard and soft approaches to countering these. Special attention will be focused on the sources of successful and ethical countering strategies; understanding mechanisms of radicalisation to and from violent extremism; evaluating proportionate state response to terror and violent extremist threats; and assessing the role of new technologies such as social media on how terrorist groups operate.",
