The aim of the unit to prepare students for future senior decision-making positions in government or the private sector. To achieve this, students will first gain a deep theoretical and conceptional understanding of leadership and decision-making. In particular, the unit will explore the limits of rationality, human cognition and other decision-making hazards. Second, the unit will invite senior leaders and decision-makers to speak to the unit (e.g. from government, academia, the media or the think-tank community). Students will be provided with ample time to ask questions and learn directly from the guest&#39;s experiences and lessons learnt. Finally, students will undertake a major independent research project where they will combine the theoretical and practical elements of leadership and decision making.",
