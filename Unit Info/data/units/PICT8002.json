    "description": "We live in an age where nations are increasingly using disinformation, deception, manipulation and coercion against foreign states and populations. Since antiquity, states have been using information warfare to pursue their international objectives. However, the rapid advancement in digital technology (e.g. social media) and the ease with which people, money and goods can now cross borders has transformed the challenges posed by information warfare. This unit explores several central questions regarding information warfare, including: (1) how does the concept of information warfare relate to its stablemates: political warfare, cyber warfare and influence operations? (2) what is the nature of the information warfare threat posed by authoritarian actors, such as China and Russia? (3) How can democracies defend themselves against authoritarian actors that are employing information warfare without forfeiting their values, norms and ethics? (4) Can democracies employ information warfare offensively? By the end of this unit, students will possess an advanced understanding of the dynamics and challenges posed by information warfare and be able to make practical policy recommendations.",
