    "description": "This unit examines the complex webs of networks and relationships involved in the development and evolution of violent extremism. These dynamics will be examined through a socio-cultural theoretical framework that draws upon contemporary terrorist scholarship including social media analysis and facilitates a critical examination of violent extremism. The unit will expose students to the complex web of socio-cultural, psychological, ideological, political and economic dynamics that produce, sustain, evolve and dissolve terrorism and violent extremism. Real world case-studies drawing on violent extremist activities, counter policies and initiatives will assist students in the formulation of sustained and persuasive arguments and techniques relating to current and future trends and patterns in the field of terrorist studies. The unit will establish a strong grounding in the theoretical constructs and techniques for a future career in the broader security discipline.",
