The course will analyse cyber attacks involving both nation state actors and non-nation state actors with political motives (including terrorists) through historical, operational and strategic perspectives. Students will gain an understanding of various definitions of cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, cyber warfare and information warfare. They will also be able to analyse how nation states and non-nation state actors utilise the Internet as an attack vector in information warfare to infiltrate digital systems to gain control of critical infrastructure. The unit is interactive and students are expected to actively participate in seminars and online discussion forums.",
