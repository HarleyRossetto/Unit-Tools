    "description": "This unit provides students with an opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired during their course to a real world crisis. After being exposed to theoretical concepts of scenario-building, role-playing and decision-making, students will experience the challenges of solving problems and finding solutions to real world crises during a dynamic simulation. They will be part of a team that includes students with different skill sets and knowledge, including strategists, intelligence analysts, criminologists, counter terrorism experts, and cyber security analysts. Students enrolled in Simulation in Security and Strategy will perform the role of the strategist. Their mission will be to formulate policy-oriented solutions by applying their theoretical knowledge and practical skills, for instance game theory. As part of a team, students will learn how to develop ministerial briefing papers during a crisis situation and how to make policy recommendations.",
