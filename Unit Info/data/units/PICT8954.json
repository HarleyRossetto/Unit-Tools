    "description": "This unit provides students with an opportunity to apply the knowledge they have gain throughout their program of study to a real world crisis. By participating in a dynamic simulation, students will be required to solve problems and find solutions to real world challenges. Students will be assigned to an executive team that includes students with different skill sets and knowledge. These executive teams may include strategists, intelligence analysts, criminologists, counter terrorism experts, and cyber security analysts. Students enrolled in Simulation in Cyber Security will perform the role of the cyber security analyst. Their mission will be to formulate solutions by employing the academic, research, analysis and workplace skills they acquired throughout their program. In particular, they will be required to use their knowledge of cyber security suites -including offensive tools- to provide detailed assessments of the evolving situation/scenario. They will also be responsible for the cyber security sections of ministerial briefing papers that each group will have to provide as part of their assessment tasks. The student will be required to make policy recommendations based on his assessment of the situation.",
