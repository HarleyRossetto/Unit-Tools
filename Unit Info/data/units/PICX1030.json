The intention is to situate criminology, and its various strands, within its particular social, political and intellectual contexts and to outline some of the key approaches associated with the field. Specifically, the unit is concerned with three broad and interrelated questions: 1) What and how societies define crime and harm in a particular way? 2) How theories of crime attempt to explain why certain people offend and certain crimes are committed? 3) What are the social responses to crime and how do institutions of criminal justice engage in mechanism of crime control?",
