It will explore the relationships between foreign policy, international relations, and community dynamics exposing students to the complexity involved in delivering and evaluating effective solutions to the dynamic security threats posed by violent extremism. It will consider the complex and inter-connected roles played by organisations at a global, national and local level including the United Nations, Attorney General&#39;s Department, Office of Premier and Cabinet, Multicultural NSW and a range of NGOs. Contemporary literature drawn from terrorism studies and real-world case-studies will expose students to important theoretical arguments relating to radicalisation, de-radicalisation, and desistance and how these impact on the delivery of effective counter-terrorism strategies.  \n\nAll enrolment queries should be directed to Open Universities Australia (OUA): see www.open.edu.au",
