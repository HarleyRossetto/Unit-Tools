This unit provides a solid foundation for terrorism studies at a postgraduate level, encouraging students to build a thorough understanding of the complex definitions, history, manifestations, and transformation of terrorism around the world. Terrorism will be critically examined as a tactic, as a strategy, and as a mode of communication. Students will explore the wider effects that terrorist discourse plays in contemporary global society, including debates around the nature and drivers of Islamist terrorism and key groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIL. The unit will also critically examine a series of current themes and questions in terrorism studies such as relationship between religion and terrorism, the media and terrorism, the realities of cyber and nuclear terrorism, the future of terrorism, and how academics can successfully conduct terrorism field research.
