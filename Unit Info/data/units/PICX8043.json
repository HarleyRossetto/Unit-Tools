The unit begins by exploring the seminal events of 9-11, the nature and challenge of the new global terrorism and the responses of the United States and other key states to it. The unit then examines the definition, causes and tactics of terrorist groups, as well as various terrorism typologies, which illustrate the diversity and complexity of terrorist groups and motivations. The unit also assesses counter-terrorism strategies as well as international counter-terrorism and policing cooperation. This unit utilizes perspectives and knowledge drawn from history, terrorism studies, foreign policy, counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency to examine, in a holistic manner, the phenomenon of contemporary terrorism and how to counter it. ",
