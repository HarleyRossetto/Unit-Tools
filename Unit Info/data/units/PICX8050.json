It exposes students to classical and contemporary approaches to strategic thought, and teaches students how to write policy briefs where they will engage with strategic problems in relation to real-world policy contexts. Content will include the fundamentals of strategy; the challenges of strategy formulation under conditions of uncertainty; the influence of bureaucratic considerations and domestic political pressures; the role of information and strategic narratives; the making of strategy in conventional and unconventional scenarios; and the dynamics of military intervention. Students will further address these issues by identifying and exploring them in cases and assessing their implications for contemporary challenges.
