Aside from exposing students to the concept of geopolitics as an analytical instrument, the unit will deal with a series of case studies, including the evolving US-Sino rivalry; the Sino-India great power game; the geopolitics of Southeast Asia; the rise of Iran, and the emerging roles of Saudi Arabia and Turkey; the question of the re-emergence of Russia and Germany as great powers; and the United Kingdom in times of Brexit.
