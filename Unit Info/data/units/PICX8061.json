    "description": "Transnational security challenges pose major problems for many states, including Australia. They also challenge the traditional conceptual foundations of international security studies based on the primacy and sovereignty of the state. For example, human migration, drug trafficking, environmental change, and organised crime contribute to the internal instability of developed as well as the developing states. In some instances, resource scarcity can even lead to interstate conflict. However, new and innovative analytical concepts are required to develop a clear appreciation of the specific nature of individual transnational problems and adequate responses. This unit will examine the theories and analytical instruments needed to critically analyse different transnational security challenges. It also examines the multi-dimensional nature of security - political, economic, military, social and cultural - and the often-intimate connection between these seemingly separate spheres or entities.",
