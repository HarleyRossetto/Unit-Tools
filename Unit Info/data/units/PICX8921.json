    "description": "The rise of China and India to great power status, arms modernisation trends across the region and unresolved territorial disputes in the South China Sea are collectively producing an unprecedented period of uncertainty in Australian defence policymaking. Against this backdrop, Australia&#39;s major ally, the United States, is increasingly expecting its allies and partners to play a more active role in the region. Consequently, the debate over Australia&#39;s strategic and defence policy choices has intensified in recent years. This unit investigates the current debates in Australia’s strategic and defence policy. Students will not only explore how external developments are shaping defence policy, but also look internally into the process of how Australian defence policymaking is created. In particular, this unit will examine the bureaucratic politics within the Department of Defence and between the three Services (Navy, Army and Air Force) when shaping defence policy.",
