    "description": "Connect with Polish language and culture through encounters with authentic written and spoken discourses. This online unit is designed to equip students with advanced level language skills to read and write about Polish short literary texts and newspaper articles. A small collection of short stories on different topics are used to enhance students&#39; competence in Polish, and to further develop skills in critical reading and textual analysis. The unit explores the relationship between authors and their texts, by examining the way linguistic and literary features participate in communicating ideas and constructing meaning. The texts&#39; themes include: patriotism, personal integrity, sense of duty, friendship, family relationships and sacrifice. Students will be equipped to flexibly navigate their way through the lexical and grammatical texture of the Polish language, broadly in alignment with B2&#43;/C1 level in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL).",
