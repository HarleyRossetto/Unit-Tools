This online unit focuses on the close analysis of a series of Polish literary and non-literary texts.

Alongside developing critical reading skills and competence in interpretative analysis, this unit aims to equip students with an in-depth knowledge of grammar and vocabulary that broadly aligns with B2&#43; level in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL).",
