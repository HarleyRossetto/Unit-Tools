    "description": "Immerse yourself in Polish literature to nuance your knowledge of the language and the cultural mindset of the people who use it. This online unit introduces students to different types and forms of Polish poetry and prose. It investigates how literature can be used as a vehicle for exploring social, cultural and historical issues. It will explore the various genres, formal features, key themes, diversity of writing styles to encourage an informed reading of different text types, and to consider the relationship between the content and form; texts and readers; and language and communication. A range of texts will be studied to help students develop a sense of how texts are socially and culturally constructed, and, in turn, how cultural context influences the way texts are written and read. More broadly, students will increase their awareness of Polish literary texts and gain an appreciation of their cultural specificity and richness.",
