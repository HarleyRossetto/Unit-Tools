This unit introduces students to the domestic politics of the Middle East, and to the intellectual and ideological currents shaping those politics. The first weeks are devoted to the contemporary history of the region from the late nineteenth century to the rise of post-colonial states in the region. Broad-ranging theoretical concepts necessary for an understanding of Middle Eastern political processes, and different ways of looking at those processes, are considered in the first part. The unit then examines the structure of government and the politics of the region, drawing on some of the ideas from the earlier part of the unit. Particular attention is paid to the region’s ongoing relations with the West and the “war against terrorism”; the emergence and future prospects of religious fundamentalism; and the rise of Arab nationalism and Zionism. The Arab-Israeli conflict, the 2003 Iraq War and the impact of globalisation are also covered.",
