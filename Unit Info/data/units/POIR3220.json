The course will emphasise the interrelatedness of national, regional and international dimensions to the understanding of the making of the contemporary Middle East. Major themes to be explored include globalisation and neo-liberalism, Political Islam, Democratisation and the crisis of government legitimacy across the region. The course will also examine the legacies of the Ottoman Era, Colonialism, the Cold War and the “War on Terror” on the shaping of the modern relations of the Middle East at both the regional and the international levels. The course will generally adopt a synoptic view of the region, by integrating historical and analytical frameworks.  The final weeks will be dedicated to the analysis of the relevant case studies as well to the international political economy and the role of other global actors in the Middle East.",
