    "description": "This unit examines why international law and global governance institutions have increasingly become instruments of choice for states as they attempt to solve common problems and express common values. Difficult questions will be addressed, including: is international law really law? Can the use of force between states really be constrained by either law or institutions? Can an impartial international court exist in the absence of a world government? Can states collectively agree on rules that accommodate divergent interests in areas such as climate change, world trade and international crime? Are powerful states above the law? To answer these questions, we first explore the sources of international law, the nature of international law and institutions, the historical and political context in which they have developed, and the role of law and global governance institutions in core theories of international relations. We then look at substantive issue areas including the use of force and the UN collective security system; terrorism; international crimes; international trade; and international environmental institutions. Finally, we examine the impact of unequal power relations on international law and global governance institutions as well as the problem of legitimacy.",
