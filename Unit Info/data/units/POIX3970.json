Students will be introduced to debates in green political theory, to developing world perspectives on environmental movements and to the ways in which environmental issues are conceptualised by major theories of international relations. Cases covered will be drawn from both Australian and international contexts. They will include climate change, geoengineering, energy security, biodiversity, human-animal relationships, food security and management of common pool resources such as forests, airsheds and fisheries.",
