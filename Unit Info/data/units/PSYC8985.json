The specific aims of the unit are to introduce students to core counselling skills within the context of the client-therapist relationship, taking into account ethical practices in working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds. Students will be introduced to the core components of (evolving) current evidence-based CBT [including cognitive therapy, behavioural strategies, exposure techniques and behavioural activation therapy) and will acquire some of the practical skills necessary to become a scientist-practitioner in the treatment of patients with anxiety, trauma and stress-related disorders (including adjustment), and mood/depressive disorders. Students will learn how to effectively draw upon and integrate interviewing, counselling and therapeutic skills associated with the cognitive behavioural therapies, as well as monitoring treatment progress and outcomes. Emphasis will be placed on client engagement, therapeutic alliance including managing ruptures, and reflective practice.",
