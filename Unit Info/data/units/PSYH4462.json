    "description": "This unit will provide an introduction to computational modelling in (cognitive) psychology. The main goals of this unit are to foster both a basic understanding of the different approaches to modelling and an appreciation of the practical and philosophical issues related to modelling. The first part of the unit will focus on the following questions: (1) What are computational models of cognition?; (2) What are the major approaches (e.g., production systems) that are used to model cognitive processes?; (3) How are models developed and used in research?; and (4) How are models compared and evaluated? The second part of the unit will examine these issues in more depth by comparing models that have been developed to account for phenomena in specific areas of cognitive research (e.g., episodic memory). The final part of the unit will consist of student-led discussions of seminal modelling papers from the students&#39; areas of interest. Students will also complete a modelling project or write a critique/review of existing models within their area of interest.",
