A series of developmental predicaments will be presented and students will be required to integrate multiple theoretical perspectives to analyse the biological, psychological and social aspects of the problem and predict developmental trajectories. The topics are based on five cases each of which will run over two weeks. Students work in small groups. The unit will introduce students to the clinical reasoning process from assessment through to theoretically informed models of intervention and the identification of potential research topics that underpin evidence-based practice.",
