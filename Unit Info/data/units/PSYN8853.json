Detailed theoretical and clinical information is provided, as well as training in the administration and scoring of selected instruments. Tests covered include those typically employed to assess intellectual function and memory, and both adult and child assessment techniques are addressed. Students are introduced to the Advanced Clinical Solutions that include tests of premorbid function, performance validity, reliable change and demographic adjustment that advance the use and interpretation of clinical assessment. To support the first supervised clinical placement, a structure for clinical interviewing and history taking is introduced; counselling and assessment skills are presented to use to support distressed and to assess suicidal clients.",
