Students will develop their knowledge of relevant clinical conditions, and the advantages and disadvantages of particular assessment procedures. Skills in case formulation, hypothesis generation and the interpretation of test results will be developed. Report writing skills will be refined, with students initially working with close supervision, but gradually developing more independence. Students are required to complete at least a thousand hours across all placements in theÂ program to meet accreditation requirements.",
