It is likely that this is a consequence of two central factors: (1) community pressure for organisations to take greater responsibility for employee mental health (as is the case for physical health), and (2) ensuring performance in a competitive commercial climate. Thus, organisational psychologist may find the requirement to blend their knowledge of organisational behaviour with knowledge of mental health as it relates to the workplace. This unit aims to provide Masters students in Organisational psychology with a basic understanding of counselling techniques, suicide-risk assessment, common psychopathology and intervention strategies and their relevance to practice within organisations.",
