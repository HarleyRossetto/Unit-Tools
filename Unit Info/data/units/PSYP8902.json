The unit teaches key aspects of the administration, scoring and interpretation of a broad range of tests likely to be utilised in professional psychology practice, including: child and adult intelligence tests;  personality tests; and tests of emotional well-being, general psychological distress, and psycho-social functioning. Students are instructed in the writing of reports in which the results of test data have to be communicated. Issues involved in the testing of special populations, such as individuals with brain injury are considered and practical experience in administration, scoring and interpretation is provided through live skills assessment. Issues of cross-cultural assessment and culture fair testing are also considered, along with practical considerations relating to the use of tests in different practice settings, including private practice.",
