    "description": "This unit provides an introduction to the complex role that psychology plays in our overall health and wellbeing. We will explore the way in which physiological, psychological and social factors interact to determine our health. Drawing on examples from common illness types including &#34;lifestyle diseases&#34; such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, we will examine the role of psychology in terms of illness and disease prevention, stress and coping, and health communications. The overall approach is to examine these factors within the context of broad populations: healthy individuals, at-risk individuals, patients, and survivors. In addition, we will explore health-related issues specific to indigenous Australians and individuals from a non-English speaking background. Through tutorial exercises and discussions, the unit ensures that students gain an appreciation of the applications of psychological principles in physical health and illness.",
