The objectives of this unit involve acquiring a basic understanding of the principal theories, key empirical research, and basic issues in the fields of social and personality psychology. Overall, the following specific knowledge and skills are expected to be acquired from this unit:- an understanding of how the scientific approach to personality and social psychology differs from common sense or lay understanding;- an awareness of research methods used in personality and social psychology research; an ability to construct an overall critical evaluation of current scientific knowledge within personality or social psychology;- an understanding of the principal personality theories, research, and the controversies that arise in this field; and- an understanding of the key theories and research in the domains of social cognition, social influence and social relations.",
