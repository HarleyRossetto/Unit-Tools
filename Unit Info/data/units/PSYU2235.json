    "description": "This unit involves the study of how humans grow and change across the life span from conception until death. The unit consolidates and extends topics introduced in the developmental section of PSYX1105. We explore developmental continuities and changes that are normative and common to most people, but also ways in which people differ from one another. In particular we focus on theories that seek to explain development and the extent to which development is influenced by genes, the physical environment, social relationships, and the context in which the individual lives. We survey major theories, research findings, and contemporary issues in physical, cognitive, social-emotional, and personality development across the life span. The tutorial sessions complement the lectures and focus on developmental research methodologies and practical applications of developmental theory.",
