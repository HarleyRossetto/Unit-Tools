    "description": "Human beings are fundamentally social creatures. Our relationships to others and the world around us are critical for our physical and psychological well-being. We all have powerful needs for connection, and a sense of identity and belonging. Similarly, we actively seek to protect ourselves from rejection, loneliness and inequitable treatment by others. While there is a long history of research on this topic, contemporary social psychology has started to examine how societal and technological advances create new challenges and opportunities for how we interact as individuals, members of groups and larger communities. This unit explores a variety of topics within interpersonal and intergroup dynamics including social connection and attraction; individual and group identity; prosocial behaviour and conflict; stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination; social justice and socio-political movements; cultural diversity and inclusion; and human-machine interaction in the virtual world. Emphasis is placed on critical examination of current theoretical and empirical approaches, as well as innovative methodologies from the fields of virtual reality, social computing, and cognitive science. Students are encouraged to integrate cultural, methodological, and theoretical perspectives to examine the complexities of social interaction across individual, group, and system levels. ",
