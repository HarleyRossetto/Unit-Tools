Students will learn how research informs clinical practice, what can be gained from studying individual cases, and how scores on standardised tests can be interpreted. Successful completion of this unit gives students an understanding of normal and abnormal functional neuroanatomy, principles of neuropsychological assessment, and of common and uncommon manifestations of acquired and developmental brain injury. One of the learning objectives of this unit is to provide an insight into the profession of neuropsychology. This unit does not prepare students for clinical practice, but familiarises them with the scientist-practitioner role of a clinical neuropsychologist.",
