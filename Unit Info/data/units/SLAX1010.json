Students who have studied Spanish or had some informal exposure to the language through family, friends or travel should contact the unit convenor before enrolling in this unit. The course follows a communicative approach and is designed to develop skills in listening comprehension and speaking, but similarly promotes proficiency in reading and writing in order to cultivate the competencies and guidelines established by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. The unit aims to prepare students to, among others: introduce themselves and others, ask and answer questions about personal details, understand and use everyday expressions, and interact in simple ways with native speakers of Spanish.
