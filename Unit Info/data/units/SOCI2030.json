    "description": "Few areas in sociology generate as many questions and as much debate as the role of social policy and the welfare state. Can we afford generous social policies or is the &#39;age of entitlement&#39; over? What role should governments, families, the community and individuals play in providing welfare? Does tighter scrutiny of welfare benefits improve efficiency and independence or is it intrusive and unfair? And, how is social policy developed in a world of competing interests and power? This unit addresses these questions as it introduces students to the history, design and institutions of social policy. We look particularly at current Australian social policy and consider how policymakers deal with problems such an ageing population, precarious work and housing, the provision of care, and the targeting and financing of a welfare state. We also explore the role that power, ideas and institutions play in shaping policy debates. The unit is especially useful for students interested in policy practice and analysis, care and human services, social inequality, and political economy.",
