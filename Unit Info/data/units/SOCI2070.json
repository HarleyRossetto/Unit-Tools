    "description": "We live in an age of super-diversity. How do we build a thriving multicultural nation where people from diverse racial, cultural and religious backgrounds are able to co-exist peacefully in a just society free from racism and discrimination? The first part of this unit explores current debates on superdiversity, urban multicultures, and new patterns of global migration. We consider the challenges of migrant and refugee settlement, barriers to social mobility and patterns of inequality among racial and ethnic minorities. We will compare different models of multiculturalism and integration before shifting attention to everyday multiculturalism and the daily lived experience of religious and cultural difference. The second part of the unit examines the sociology of race, discrimination and racism – from the structural to the everyday. Students will be introduced to concepts such as intersectionality and post-colonial sociology and we will investigate issues facing Aboriginal people in Australia today. We explore what sociology has to say about the surge in national populisms and the rise of the far right and why it is that race,  immigration, and religion so commonly animate such movements. We also consider the role of social media in this resurgence. Finally, the unit explores anti-racism and the tools available to challenge discrimination and seek racial justice.",
