Research into global issues includes international migration, global cities, the rise of information &amp; surveillance capitalism, global value chains and transnational financial flows, global interconnections of everyday actors and elites and the global consequences of climate change. Students explore the role of local communities and cultures in reshaping and regulating global forces and power structures underpinning globalism, nationalism and cosmopolitanism. We will examine the changing roles of civil society and local community in creating alternatives to the twin powers of states and markets, from successes and failures to future opportunities and emerging risks. By exploring the relationships between space, place and people through contemporary case studies (for example, global cities and social infrastructures, the sociology of risk and crisis, resilience and disasters; global migration, border politics and citizenship rights) students will build on and extend previous learning in theory and methods, with the option of a fieldwork project focused on a case study.",
