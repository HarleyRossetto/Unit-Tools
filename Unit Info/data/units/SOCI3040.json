We explore the links between informal supports, typically, although not exclusively, provided by women within families and households; and formal supports as provided by professional, trained and untrained staff, through organisations and other, often newly emergent, systems of support. Drawing together the fields of social theory and applied research, this unit provides an opportunity to examine responses to changing concepts of human need for interpersonal support. You will be able to learn from policy makers and practitioners working in this field, and analyse current research on care and human services in Australia and other comparable countries.",
