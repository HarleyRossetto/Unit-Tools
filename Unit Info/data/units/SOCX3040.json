However, additional research will be required by students to obtain the resources they require to inform their program design.\n\nTo undertake this exercise effectively, you will initially need to identify a human services field within which you can develop a program (or human services innovation). Related to this is identifying a need that your program intends to address. These could be for example, a program for ‘at-risk youth’, an early-intervention and prevention program for children, a programs to address isolation among older people, or a service program to meet the needs of recently active military personnel. \n\nThe presentation should address the following components/questions (that will be used as a guide during the tutorials):\n1) Program Overview\n2) Statement of Outcomes\n3) Environmental Context your program is working within\n4) Potential demand for your program\n5) Client group of the program\n6) Detailed Program Description\n7) Concrete resources for your program, including a budget",

Drawing together the fields of social theory and applied research, this unit provides an opportunity to examine responses to changing concepts of human need for interpersonal support. You will be able to learn from policy makers and practitioners working in this field, and analyse current research on care and human services in Australia and other comparable countries.",
