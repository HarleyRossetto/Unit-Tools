    "description": "Evaluation is among the most common, and possibly most useful, forms of applied social research. It involves using research methodologies to systematically assess a policy or program to set criteria. This unit surveys key topics and practice-based skills widely used in evaluation research that have potential applications in the public, non-profit, and for-profit private sectors. As this field of research is expansive, the unit primarily draws on case studies from social policy - public interventions that are amongst those that have most bearing on the everyday lives of the citizenry - to provide focus for class sessions and assessments. The unit proceeds in four modules. The first module provides context by engaging with key understandings of social policies and programs. The second module introduces key evaluation tools and skills for understanding programs and focusing research. The third module focuses on issues in designing and carrying out evaluations, from small-scale projects to those analysing &#39;big data&#39;. And, the fourth module discusses the politics of evaluation and evidence in policy making to draw out key political and ethical questions. Across these four modules, you will gain a clear understanding of key elements of evaluation research design, as well as the potential uses and misuses of this form of applied social policy research.",
