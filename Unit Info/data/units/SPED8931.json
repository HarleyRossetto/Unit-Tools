    "description": "This unit aims to provide teachers of the deaf with a broad overview of auditory development and audiological practice. Students will be introduced to the anatomy and physiology of hearing as a basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying auditory perception. The causes and implications of various types of hearing loss will be examined. Procedures and testing techniques will also be explored. Topics covered in this area will include screening, behavioural assessment, objective assessment, and evoked potential testing techniques. Students will develop an understanding of clinical reports and audiograms. Hearing aids, implantable devices, and other assistive listening devices are reviewed and students will learn skills in troubleshooting and monitoring such devices.",
