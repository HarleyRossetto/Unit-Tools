    "description": "This unit presents an introduction to speech perception and speech production of children who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing. Students will be introduced to the anatomy and physiology of the systems related to speech production, psychoacoustics and the speech chain. Typical speech perception and the continuum of development supporting the emergence of mature speech production will be considered. Listening and speech production assessments used in deaf education will be outlined, and results reviewed to determine specific goals.  Strategies to improve student outcomes and programming for Teachers of the Deaf to implement with their students will be explored.",
