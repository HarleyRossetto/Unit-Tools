Throughout the unit, we build on this basis in considering different types of brain damage that are associated with communication disorders (for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury). Topics include: aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments, acquired reading and spelling disorders; motor speech disorders, and bilingual aphasia.",
