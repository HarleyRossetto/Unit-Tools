    "description": "This unit is a detailed examination of speech perception and hearing, and provides training in the scientific methods required to expand knowledge in both domains. This unit is based around interactive lectures that present the theoretical content, and practical workshops that support students in completing research projects and proposals. Essential topics in speech perception include the (categorical) perception of segments and the perception and processing of prosody. These are introduced from the perspective of monolingual adults, and further explored in a range of other populations, including bilinguals and listeners with hearing loss. The discussion of hearing covers the structure of the outer, middle and inner ear, the auditory nerve, the auditory brainstem and the auditory cortex, as well as the mechanisms of hearing and the physiology of the auditory system. A final focus of this unit is the psychoacoustics of hearing and speech perception.",
