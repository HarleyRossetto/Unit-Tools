    "description": "Qualitative inquiry aims to access ‘human stories’ and lives as they unfold or through the traces people leave behind. How do people interact in and understand their social worlds? How do these interactions and perceptions shape their outlook, behaviour, and experiences in particular situations? This unit focuses on the valuable insights that qualitative inquiry can provide to address these questions. The unit proceeds in three parts. The first part surveys influential approaches to qualitative research design, highlighting the importance of understanding social context as well as managing the relationship between theory, method and analysis. The second part focuses on how to ethically apply common data collection methods used in qualitative inquiry, from interviews to observational techniques to unobtrusive practices. The third part of the unit examines how to manage and analyse qualitative data in a critical, robust and systematic manner. In this unit, students will gain insight into how to design and carry out quality qualitative research into social lives and important social issues.",
