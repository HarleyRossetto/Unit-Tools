    "description": "The unit introduces students to the logic of quantitative social inquiry, with a specific focus on social surveys. Social surveys are widely employed in today’s social science workplaces, with an array of uses in policy-making, public debate and social research. Survey methodologies collect systematic information about cases and present this information in a structured ‘data grid’, which can be used to test theoretically informed hypotheses and inferences. Surveys are used in many different types of studies, from quasi-experiments to cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Building on SSCI1000 and SSCI2010, the unit focuses on linking quantitative research design to data analysis, including the deductive logic of quantitative research and analysis. Students learn how to develop survey questionnaires and collect other forms of quantitative data, as well as how to use computer software to analyse survey data. The unit aims to show that credible findings from survey research are as reliant on collecting valid and reliable data as they are on applying relevant analytic techniques.",
