What are the main applications of social science in today’s workplace? This unit focuses on evaluation and policy research, which apply social science theories and methods to ascertain whether a program or policy intervention is making a difference. This unit has three parts. The first examines the policy context of evaluation and applied social science. In the second part, we survey influential research designs for evaluation and applied social science that incorporate qualitative and/or quantitative methods. And, in the third part, we consider ethical and practical issues that arise when designing and doing applied social science. Through these three parts, the unit aims to introduce students to the skills required to design ethical and robust evaluations and applied social science projects. By doing this, the unit applies knowledge and methodologies from earlier social science units to practical situations in order to prepare students for working on a professional social research project as part of the capstone unit.  ",
