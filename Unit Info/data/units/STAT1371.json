The unit provides an introduction to modern statistical principles and practice with special emphasis on data analytical techniques. The aim of the unit is to promote an understanding of the principles involved in statistical analysis of simple data sets using elementary techniques. Data analysis will be carried out using an appropriate statistical package. The unit includes topics such as numeric and visual summaries of sample data; data quality; basic probability and random variables, including the binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, hypergeometric, uniform and normal distributions. Sampling distributions and their important properties are used to investigate estimates and their accuracy. Statistical inference techniques are considered such as tests of means, proportions, categorical data as well as regression and correlation.",
