    "description": "This unit exposes students to real-life biostatistical problems, with the aim of consolidating concepts and theories learnt through the program and further developing their analytical skills. A project may include any of the following: primary or secondary analysis of health data; scientific manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal; design work on a study, eg clinical trial or health survey; statistical consulting project; evaluation of a data collection, data management or health information system from the perspective of statistical analysis of the data. When more than one project is completed (ie, STAT8651 and STAT8652), the projects should not be of the same type and must involve the use of different statistical methods and concepts. At least one project should involve complex multivariable data analysis. Because of the multi-institutional nature of the Biostatistics units, there is an early cut-off for enrolment in this unit, which is typically one week before the start of the session. Please contact the program coordinator for details.",
