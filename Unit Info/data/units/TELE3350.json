The focus is on layers 1 and 2 of the OSI reference model spanning local-area, wide-area, metropolitan and access networks and includes Ethernet, wireless networks, optical networks, time-division multiplexing networks and cellular networks. The unit examines these technologies from a number of different perspectives including physical-layer communications, medium access control (MAC), link-layer, network structure, devices, modelling, performance analysis and quality of service. A practical component gives students skills in using and configuring network equipment and modelling and analysis tools.",
