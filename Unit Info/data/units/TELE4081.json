The key telecommunications engineering performance indicators such as bit error rates, spectrum utilisation, throughput, delay and diversity are studied in detail and they are gauged by means of software-defined probes attached to the telecommunications system components. The practical computer-aided signal processing and digital communications techniques to manage and optimise these key performance indicators are taught when transmitted data is corrupted by channel noise and fading.",
