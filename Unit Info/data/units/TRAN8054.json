The unit includes language structure (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse) based on the Auslan corpus, in a top-down approach, starting with the semiotic elements available to all languages. The use of space, depicting signs and constructed action are a major applied focus at the on-campus sessions. Students also apply their linguistic knowledge to the computerised annotation and analysis of an Auslan text.",
