It enables students to develop their consecutive interpreting skills in three stages: Stage One is devoted to consecutive without note-taking, which is to train students to understand the logic of speeches, the role of memorisation and the importance of discourse analysis. Stage Two requires students to interpret extemporaneous and short speeches (of three minutes) to improve their intensive analytical listening and their understanding of the structural organisation of those speeches. In Stage Three students are required to manage increasingly difficult and challenging speeches of five to 10 minutes duration on commercial, technical and political topics.",
