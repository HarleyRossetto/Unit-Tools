You will: * Formulate a research question within the framework of the translation theory you have chosen. * Collect and analyse data using a method appropriate to the research question and theoretical framework. * Interpret the data you collected by critically integrating it with the key theoretical constructs in the paradigm you have chosen. * You should present your research project in the form of a 1500-word research report.
