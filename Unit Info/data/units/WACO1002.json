    "description": "This unit is designed to support students in their transition to university by enabling them to understand and achieve standards of performance required in an academic environment. The unit provides a three-level focus which is initiated by facilitating the development of academic practices, behaviours and values. Secondly, it fosters a level of familiarity with the disciplinary language, text types and  academic conventions used when studying in programs offered by the Faculty of Science. Finally, the unit raises an awareness of the impact of scientific knowledge and the role of scientists when they act to solve problems and implement innovations affecting contemporary society. Learning and assessment activities are designed to build the capacity for independent and collaborative approaches to learning. Students are guided to develop their capacity for reading, thinking and expressing ideas effectively and critically.",
