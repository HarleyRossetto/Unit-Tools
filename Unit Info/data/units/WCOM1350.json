The unit will cover conceptual modelling techniques, converting conceptual data models into relational data models and verifying their structural characteristics with normalisation techniques, and implementing and utilising a relational database using a database-management system. Fundamental data modelling tools, techniques such as ER Modelling and query languages such as Structured Query Language (SQL) will be used. Concepts relating to data warehousing, governance, administration, security and privacy, ethical and green approaches to the collection, backup, use and storage of data and the construction of systems are also discussed. Overall, this unit concentrates on building a firm foundation in information representation, organisation and storage with particular emphasis on the application of database systems.",
