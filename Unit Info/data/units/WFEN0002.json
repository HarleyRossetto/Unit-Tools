Through the analysis of contentious issues, the unit focuses on the development of language and academic literacy skills to give students the means to participate effectively in higher education studies. The unit builds on and extends the skills learnt in Academic English 1 and helps to develop the language and academic skills required for the production of longer written texts and for use in sustained interactive spoken contexts. It provides practical help for consolidating essential skills for academic study, such as paraphrasing, synthesising, referencing, interactive discussion strategies and critical thinking. The unit also guides students in the development of self and peer assessment as well as active collaboration. It provides a foundational scaffold for students continuing to Research for University Studies.",
