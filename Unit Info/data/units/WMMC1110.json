In Week 6, Lesson 3, students are to write a reflection on their Video Project. Students will be given 30 minutes in class to write two paragraphs in response to questions provided by the teacher. The written reflection is worth 10% of the overall mark for the unit. This assignment encourages students to reflect on the suitability and scope of their video project with respect to its relevance to the unit. A good reflection will summarize the best aspects of the project while also outlining what could have been improved. Responses should focus on the research and the creative process of the project rather than on personal issues faced. As students will view/listen to other students’ work in Lessons 1 and 2 in week 6, they will be required to include references to some positive aspects of other students&#39; work, and how they might have integrated these ideas into their own work.",

Students will make a video to communicate their analysis and evaluation. Students may choose a platform such as YouTube or Vimeo, but it is the student’s responsibility to make sure that the project can be accessed by staff (i.e. it should not be password protected or private). Videos should have a duration of no more than 4 minutes. A fully referenced transcript/script of the video, including a hyperlink to the video should be submitted to Turnitin by the deadline.
